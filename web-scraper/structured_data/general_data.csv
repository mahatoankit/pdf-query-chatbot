This would affect students who are active on social media platforms, potentially limiting their ability to express themselves freely. How Will This Affect Nepalese Students? Impact on Freedom of ExpressionOne of the main concerns about the bill is its potential effect on freedom of speech and expression. While the governments intention is to curb harmful content, such as hate speech and cyberbullying, there is worry that the broad nature of the regulations could also suppress legitimate expression. For students who use social media to engage in activism, academic discussions, or even personal expression, the fear of unwarranted censorship or punishment could lead to self-censorship and limited discourse online. Education and LearningMany students rely on social media platforms for educational content, online courses, webinars, and knowledge-sharing. However, the new Bills stringent content regulations could restrict access to certain types of content or make platforms overly cautious about the content they allow. Students who use YouTube, LinkedIn, and other social media for professional networking, learning, and career growth might find themselves limited by the need for companies to censor certain types of content to comply with the Bill. Online Privacy and Data SecurityOne of the Bills main selling points is its promise to improve information security, privacy of personal data, and cyber security. While this is an encouraging development, students will need to remain vigilant about their online footprint. The fear of stricter regulations could cause students to reconsider how much personal information they share on social media, which could have implications for those looking to build their online presence, especially for career networking or self-branding. Fines and AccountabilityWith fines of up to Rs 500,000 for users who engage in online activities deemed harmful, students may feel more apprehensive about their interactions on social media. The Bills broad scope, covering actions such as posting, liking, commenting, or tagging with the wrong intention, means that students could be penalized for actions that may seem innocuous or unintentional. This could make students more cautious, reducing their willingness to participate in conversations or share content freely. A Changing Social Media LandscapeThe implementation of the Social Media Council Bill will undoubtedly reshape the way social media operates in Nepal. With stricter regulations on digital platforms, students may find themselves navigating a more controlled online space. This could impact everything from group discussions, student activism, and university-related social media projects to career-building efforts on platforms like LinkedIn. It may also push students to look for new, alternative platforms to communicate or organize, especially if they feel stifled by existing social media regulations. Conclusion: Adapting to a New Digital EnvironmentAs Nepal moves forward with the Social Media Council Bill, students will need to adjust to the new reality of a more regulated digital space. While the intent of the Bill is to foster a safer, more secure online environment, students must stay informed about how the new regulations will affect their digital interactions. Understanding the implications of the Bill will help students protect their rights to freedom of expression, navigate the new rules on digital conduct, and continue using social media platforms in a responsible and creative way.

Posted on July 26, 2023January 26, 2024 by admin Threads is a social networking software developed by Meta, which created Instagram and Facebook. Threads allow you to see a feed of everything thats going on with your friends or persons youre interested in. You may also upload messages, text, images, and videos. You might also respond to or like messages. Threads Vs Twitter Twitter has increased the number of advertisements that appear after one out of every five postings. An individual has a large number of bot accounts and improper accounts that need to be detected. Twitter charges for verification, risking fake paid Elon Musk accounts. Limited daily tweets can be viewed unless users pay to increase the limit. Threads aims to counter negative sentiment toward Twitter meta, explicitly stating no monetization until the app hits a billion users. How do Threads work? Theyve adjusted it so that everyone must have an Instagram account before theyre able to sign up, which has significantly reduced the degree of Bot activity. Because its linked to your Instagram account, you wont have to pay for verification, and it will automatically transfer from your Instagram to your Threads account. Threads unexpected buzz makes it seem like everyone is already there, a challenge for new platforms. When one of your Instagram followers signs up for Threads, they automatically follow you, giving the user a huge boost in enthusiasm. As a result, threads seem like this New Haven is like a fresh start on Twitter. Because of his superb timing and some big-brain marketing, Mark Zuckerberg has become the new Peoples Choice hero. Theyve also figured out how to develop an enormous fear of missing out among those on the outside. Registering quickly for a Threads account earns you a rating, akin to a race assessment. What makes Twitter differ from Threads? Threads vs Twitter Twitters unique focus on news fosters real-time discussions, allowing users to engage and learn about global events and perspectives. The app Threads faces a data issue, as it currently does not comply with the strict data laws of the European Union. Automatic Status Sharing The software also introduces the notion of automated status sharing, which allows users to automatically share their activities and locations. Threads intelligently recognize and share information about a users current status, such as location, movement, or even the music they are listening to, using powerful AI algorithms. While these capabilities may raise privacy concerns for some users, the app assures that users control information sharing, emphasizing transparency and consent. Conclusion Threads intended to debut in a minimal, stable state for V1, resembling Twitter with deliberate Instagram design aspects. Moreover, it is appropriately called since users have begun to refer to Threads as strings of messages, and its straightforward, with your newsfeed consisting of individuals you follow and those you dont. It nails the basicsvisually appealing, runs smoothly, almost bug-freemaking it a less overwhelming alternative to Twitter.

Posted in UncategorizedLeave a Comment on All you need to know about BSc Hons Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Scope  Placements  Career How does the For You algorithm work in TikTok? Posted on October 13, 2022June 9, 2023 by admin Have you ever wondered how the TikTok algorithm work? Let us review and understand. TikTok is addictive. It is so addictive that 9 out of 10 users on TikTok use it daily for hours. How do we spend hours on TikTok, even if its a short-content platform? Lets understand how the TikTok For You algorithm works. We will also cover how the basic recommendation algorithm works. Working of TikTok For You Page Recommendation Algorithm Before going in depth on how the TikTok algorithm works, let us understand the metadata. Metadata is the data that provides information about the data. This data helps identify and categorize the content for various backend purposes. Metadata of TikTok Videos Hashtags Hashtags are a few phrases attached to the end of the captions so they can help the algorithm understand the content type. The video uploader usually chooses this. Hashtags are better for a new content creator because they help TikTok identify the type of content theyre uploading. Music TikToks are frequently associated with music. TikTok made a significant move by using copyrighted music as a streaming platform, allowing creators to attach sounds without fear of copyright infringement. The music we choose for a TikTok video categorizes it as well, making it one of the more important pieces of metadata. Content-Duration TikTok is slowly increasing its video content duration limit. The platform started with a 15-second video uploaded over 10 minutes today. The length of the video also categorizes it, making it metadata for a TikTok video. Creator The creator uploading the content is by far the most critical metadata to categorize TikTok videos. Similarly, other metadata such as uploaded time, location, date, and video quality are a few other examples of metadata for a TikTok video. Consumer Ratings on TikTok When a video is released, TikTok usually sends it to all of its active users at once, who are usually chosen based on the metadata of the video that they are watching. Implicit Ratings Implicit ratings are ratings that occur as a result of behavior and cannot be faked by the user. For example, ordering a product from an online store. A few implicit ratings for TikTok videos are: View Time: During the initial video shoot, TikTok closely monitors the average watch duration of the video. There is a trend of looping a TikTok video so that the end can be unnoticed; the clever creator does it so that the watch duration exceeds the actual content duration, signaling the TikTok algorithm. Video Skips: A video viewer usually skips a video when they dont like it. This can be an important signal for TikTok to stop recommending the video that has been skipped and instead recommend some other content category. Profile Visit When consumers like the video, they usually visit the creators profile. This can count as an implicit rating as the user is indicating that they like the creator and want to consume similar content. Explicit Ratings Explicit ratings are the ratings that the user explicitly creates, which means theres some effort in creating explicit ratings. For example, liking a TikTok video A few explicit ratings for TikTok videos are: Likes: The user usually double-taps when they like the content, this helps to increase the likes count for a video and helps the algorithm. Comments: A comment on a video can act as a powerful explicit rating if there is more time and effort required to do so. Shares: Shares are also one of the most powerful explicit ratings as it is one of the rarest ratings, and parallelly, it also creates more exposure for the content. How TikTok algorithm work in recommended videos? As we have understood all the following terms, now we can understand how TikTok algorithm work to recommended videos. Step 1: The user uploads the video, and TikTok takes a few minutes to understand the content based on metadata. Step 2: TikTok distributes the video to a few active users in order to collect preliminary consumption data. Step 3: TikTok typically suggests the video to users who are watching other similarly category videos based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video. Step 4: Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. In conclusion, TikTok is a video-editing app that sends videos to a few active users to collect initial consumption results. Based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video, TikTok usually recommends the content to users who are consuming similar videos. Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. A message from the Sunway Social media and its uses have spread like wildfire lately.

https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/#primary,"admin, Author at Sunway College Kathmandu",,,"Author: admin How Nepals Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS Could Impact Students: A Closer Look Posted on February 21, 2025February 21, 2025 by admin In a move that has sparked significant discussion across various sectors, the Nepalese government recently presented the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS in the National Assembly. Tabled by the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, the Bill aims to regulate the growing use of social media platforms, holding users and operators accountable for their actions. While the government cites its goal of promoting social goodwill, cultural tolerance, and good governance, there are growing concerns about how this Bill will impact students, particularly in terms of their freedom of expression and online engagement. Understanding the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BSThe bill seeks to establish clear guidelines for social media operators and users, focusing on ensuring a safe and secure digital environment. Among its key provisions, it outlines the following:Licensing for Digital Platforms: Companies or institutions operating digital platforms will need to obtain a license, valid for two years, to run social media sites in Nepal. Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to the revocation of their operating license. Content Regulations: The Bill targets cyberbullying, identity theft, misinformation, hate speech, deep fake videos, and other harmful digital behaviors. It also aims to control the spread of content that could jeopardize national peace, security, or sovereignty. Fines and Penalties: Users who engage in harmful online activities such as trolling, spreading false information, or engaging in online harassment could face fines of up to Rs 500,000. This would affect students who are active on social media platforms, potentially limiting their ability to express themselves freely. How Will This Affect Nepalese Students? Impact on Freedom of ExpressionOne of the main concerns about the bill is its potential effect on freedom of speech and expression. While the governments intention is to curb harmful content, such as hate speech and cyberbullying, there is worry that the broad nature of the regulations could also suppress legitimate expression. For students who use social media to engage in activism, academic discussions, or even personal expression, the fear of unwarranted censorship or punishment could lead to self-censorship and limited discourse online. Education and LearningMany students rely on social media platforms for educational content, online courses, webinars, and knowledge-sharing. However, the new Bills stringent content regulations could restrict access to certain types of content or make platforms overly cautious about the content they allow. Students who use YouTube, LinkedIn, and other social media for professional networking, learning, and career growth might find themselves limited by the need for companies to censor certain types of content to comply with the Bill. Online Privacy and Data SecurityOne of the Bills main selling points is its promise to improve information security, privacy of personal data, and cyber security. While this is an encouraging development, students will need to remain vigilant about their online footprint. The fear of stricter regulations could cause students to reconsider how much personal information they share on social media, which could have implications for those looking to build their online presence, especially for career networking or self-branding. Fines and AccountabilityWith fines of up to Rs 500,000 for users who engage in online activities deemed harmful, students may feel more apprehensive about their interactions on social media. The Bills broad scope, covering actions such as posting, liking, commenting, or tagging with the wrong intention, means that students could be penalized for actions that may seem innocuous or unintentional. This could make students more cautious, reducing their willingness to participate in conversations or share content freely. A Changing Social Media LandscapeThe implementation of the Social Media Council Bill will undoubtedly reshape the way social media operates in Nepal. With stricter regulations on digital platforms, students may find themselves navigating a more controlled online space. This could impact everything from group discussions, student activism, and university-related social media projects to career-building efforts on platforms like LinkedIn. It may also push students to look for new, alternative platforms to communicate or organize, especially if they feel stifled by existing social media regulations. Conclusion: Adapting to a New Digital EnvironmentAs Nepal moves forward with the Social Media Council Bill, students will need to adjust to the new reality of a more regulated digital space. While the intent of the Bill is to foster a safer, more secure online environment, students must stay informed about how the new regulations will affect their digital interactions. Understanding the implications of the Bill will help students protect their rights to freedom of expression, navigate the new rules on digital conduct, and continue using social media platforms in a responsible and creative way.

Posted in UncategorizedLeave a Comment on All you need to know about BSc Hons Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Scope  Placements  Career How does the For You algorithm work in TikTok? Posted on October 13, 2022June 9, 2023 by admin Have you ever wondered how the TikTok algorithm work? Let us review and understand. TikTok is addictive. It is so addictive that 9 out of 10 users on TikTok use it daily for hours. How do we spend hours on TikTok, even if its a short-content platform? Lets understand how the TikTok For You algorithm works. We will also cover how the basic recommendation algorithm works. Working of TikTok For You Page Recommendation Algorithm Before going in depth on how the TikTok algorithm works, let us understand the metadata. Metadata is the data that provides information about the data. This data helps identify and categorize the content for various backend purposes. Metadata of TikTok Videos Hashtags Hashtags are a few phrases attached to the end of the captions so they can help the algorithm understand the content type. The video uploader usually chooses this. Hashtags are better for a new content creator because they help TikTok identify the type of content theyre uploading. Music TikToks are frequently associated with music. TikTok made a significant move by using copyrighted music as a streaming platform, allowing creators to attach sounds without fear of copyright infringement. The music we choose for a TikTok video categorizes it as well, making it one of the more important pieces of metadata. Content-Duration TikTok is slowly increasing its video content duration limit. The platform started with a 15-second video uploaded over 10 minutes today. The length of the video also categorizes it, making it metadata for a TikTok video. Creator The creator uploading the content is by far the most critical metadata to categorize TikTok videos. Similarly, other metadata such as uploaded time, location, date, and video quality are a few other examples of metadata for a TikTok video. Consumer Ratings on TikTok When a video is released, TikTok usually sends it to all of its active users at once, who are usually chosen based on the metadata of the video that they are watching. Implicit Ratings Implicit ratings are ratings that occur as a result of behavior and cannot be faked by the user. For example, ordering a product from an online store. A few implicit ratings for TikTok videos are: View Time: During the initial video shoot, TikTok closely monitors the average watch duration of the video. There is a trend of looping a TikTok video so that the end can be unnoticed; the clever creator does it so that the watch duration exceeds the actual content duration, signaling the TikTok algorithm. Video Skips: A video viewer usually skips a video when they dont like it. This can be an important signal for TikTok to stop recommending the video that has been skipped and instead recommend some other content category. Profile Visit When consumers like the video, they usually visit the creators profile. This can count as an implicit rating as the user is indicating that they like the creator and want to consume similar content. Explicit Ratings Explicit ratings are the ratings that the user explicitly creates, which means theres some effort in creating explicit ratings. For example, liking a TikTok video A few explicit ratings for TikTok videos are: Likes: The user usually double-taps when they like the content, this helps to increase the likes count for a video and helps the algorithm. Comments: A comment on a video can act as a powerful explicit rating if there is more time and effort required to do so. Shares: Shares are also one of the most powerful explicit ratings as it is one of the rarest ratings, and parallelly, it also creates more exposure for the content. How TikTok algorithm work in recommended videos? As we have understood all the following terms, now we can understand how TikTok algorithm work to recommended videos. Step 1: The user uploads the video, and TikTok takes a few minutes to understand the content based on metadata. Step 2: TikTok distributes the video to a few active users in order to collect preliminary consumption data. Step 3: TikTok typically suggests the video to users who are watching other similarly category videos based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video. Step 4: Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. In conclusion, TikTok is a video-editing app that sends videos to a few active users to collect initial consumption results. Based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video, TikTok usually recommends the content to users who are consuming similar videos. Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. A message from the Sunway Social media and its uses have spread like wildfire lately. People are out and about promoting themselves, their products and services, and their way of life, whether for business or personal reasons. This is what is seen as the new normal for many.

https://sunway.edu.np/category/blog/,Blog Archives - Sunway College Kathmandu,,,"Category: Blog How Nepals Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS Could Impact Students: A Closer Look Posted on February 21, 2025February 21, 2025 by admin In a move that has sparked significant discussion across various sectors, the Nepalese government recently presented the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS in the National Assembly. Tabled by the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, the Bill aims to regulate the growing use of social media platforms, holding users and operators accountable for their actions. While the government cites its goal of promoting social goodwill, cultural tolerance, and good governance, there are growing concerns about how this Bill will impact students, particularly in terms of their freedom of expression and online engagement. Understanding the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BSThe bill seeks to establish clear guidelines for social media operators and users, focusing on ensuring a safe and secure digital environment. Among its key provisions, it outlines the following:Licensing for Digital Platforms: Companies or institutions operating digital platforms will need to obtain a license, valid for two years, to run social media sites in Nepal. Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to the revocation of their operating license. Content Regulations: The Bill targets cyberbullying, identity theft, misinformation, hate speech, deep fake videos, and other harmful digital behaviors. It also aims to control the spread of content that could jeopardize national peace, security, or sovereignty. Fines and Penalties: Users who engage in harmful online activities such as trolling, spreading false information, or engaging in online harassment could face fines of up to Rs 500,000. This would affect students who are active on social media platforms, potentially limiting their ability to express themselves freely. How Will This Affect Nepalese Students? Impact on Freedom of ExpressionOne of the main concerns about the bill is its potential effect on freedom of speech and expression. While the governments intention is to curb harmful content, such as hate speech and cyberbullying, there is worry that the broad nature of the regulations could also suppress legitimate expression. For students who use social media to engage in activism, academic discussions, or even personal expression, the fear of unwarranted censorship or punishment could lead to self-censorship and limited discourse online. Education and LearningMany students rely on social media platforms for educational content, online courses, webinars, and knowledge-sharing. However, the new Bills stringent content regulations could restrict access to certain types of content or make platforms overly cautious about the content they allow. Students who use YouTube, LinkedIn, and other social media for professional networking, learning, and career growth might find themselves limited by the need for companies to censor certain types of content to comply with the Bill. Online Privacy and Data SecurityOne of the Bills main selling points is its promise to improve information security, privacy of personal data, and cyber security. While this is an encouraging development, students will need to remain vigilant about their online footprint. The fear of stricter regulations could cause students to reconsider how much personal information they share on social media, which could have implications for those looking to build their online presence, especially for career networking or self-branding. Fines and AccountabilityWith fines of up to Rs 500,000 for users who engage in online activities deemed harmful, students may feel more apprehensive about their interactions on social media. The Bills broad scope, covering actions such as posting, liking, commenting, or tagging with the wrong intention, means that students could be penalized for actions that may seem innocuous or unintentional. This could make students more cautious, reducing their willingness to participate in conversations or share content freely. A Changing Social Media LandscapeThe implementation of the Social Media Council Bill will undoubtedly reshape the way social media operates in Nepal. With stricter regulations on digital platforms, students may find themselves navigating a more controlled online space. This could impact everything from group discussions, student activism, and university-related social media projects to career-building efforts on platforms like LinkedIn. It may also push students to look for new, alternative platforms to communicate or organize, especially if they feel stifled by existing social media regulations. Conclusion: Adapting to a New Digital EnvironmentAs Nepal moves forward with the Social Media Council Bill, students will need to adjust to the new reality of a more regulated digital space. While the intent of the Bill is to foster a safer, more secure online environment, students must stay informed about how the new regulations will affect their digital interactions. Understanding the implications of the Bill will help students protect their rights to freedom of expression, navigate the new rules on digital conduct, and continue using social media platforms in a responsible and creative way.

This intricate ecosystem of interconnected technologies has steadily evolved over decades, contributing to its current complexity and ubiquity. Understanding the history of AI unveils a layered narrative, showcasing the diverse tools and capabilities that have molded it into the game-changing force it represents today. Tracing the trajectory of AIs development is key to comprehending its present importance and preparing for its future implications. By examining its origins and evolutionary path, we gain valuable insights into how AI has transformed from a conceptual idea into a transformative technology that profoundly influences our daily routines and shapes industries across the spectrum. grasping the past paves the way for harnessing the potential of AI in our ever-evolving world. History of Artificial Intelligence from Academic Roots to Practical Progress AIs origins lie within the academic halls of prestigious university research departments, initially pondered by scholars envisioning computings future. However, its infancy tethered it to these domains, hampered by scarce data and limited computational prowess. A pivotal moment arose in 1956 at Dartmouth College, where the renowned Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence convened. This workshop aimed to validate the notion that machines could simulate learning with precisiona groundbreaking hypothesis explored by 20 researchers. In subsequent years, significant strides marked AIs trajectory. American psychologist Frank Rosenblatts perceptron algorithm, born from Dartmouths research, demonstrated successful binary classification, offering glimpses into artificial neurons learning potential. Concurrently, John McCarthy, an attendee of the Dartmouth project, along with MIT students, pioneered Lisp, a novel programming language laying the groundwork for future advancements like the SHRDLU natural language program and others. The 1960s witnessed the emergence of Simulmatics, a company claiming to predict voting patterns based on demographics. By 1965, expert systems surfaced, allowing AI to tackle specialized problems using factual databases and inference engines. MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaums Eliza in 1966 showcased AIs intelligence by engaging users as pseudo-therapists, responding to their inputs with open-ended questions.

Online Privacy and Data SecurityOne of the Bills main selling points is its promise to improve information security, privacy of personal data, and cyber security. While this is an encouraging development, students will need to remain vigilant about their online footprint. The fear of stricter regulations could cause students to reconsider how much personal information they share on social media, which could have implications for those looking to build their online presence, especially for career networking or self-branding. Fines and AccountabilityWith fines of up to Rs 500,000 for users who engage in online activities deemed harmful, students may feel more apprehensive about their interactions on social media. The Bills broad scope, covering actions such as posting, liking, commenting, or tagging with the wrong intention, means that students could be penalized for actions that may seem innocuous or unintentional. This could make students more cautious, reducing their willingness to participate in conversations or share content freely. A Changing Social Media LandscapeThe implementation of the Social Media Council Bill will undoubtedly reshape the way social media operates in Nepal. With stricter regulations on digital platforms, students may find themselves navigating a more controlled online space. This could impact everything from group discussions, student activism, and university-related social media projects to career-building efforts on platforms like LinkedIn. It may also push students to look for new, alternative platforms to communicate or organize, especially if they feel stifled by existing social media regulations. Conclusion: Adapting to a New Digital EnvironmentAs Nepal moves forward with the Social Media Council Bill, students will need to adjust to the new reality of a more regulated digital space. While the intent of the Bill is to foster a safer, more secure online environment, students must stay informed about how the new regulations will affect their digital interactions. Understanding the implications of the Bill will help students protect their rights to freedom of expression, navigate the new rules on digital conduct, and continue using social media platforms in a responsible and creative way.

https://sunway.edu.np/how-nepals-social-media-council-bill-2081-bs-could-impact-students-a-closer-look/#respond,"How Nepals Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS Could Impact Students: A Closer Look - Sunway College Kathmandu",2025-02-21T05:10:48+00:00,Sunway College Kathmandu Blog -,"How Nepals Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS Could Impact Students: A Closer Look Posted on February 21, 2025February 21, 2025 by admin In a move that has sparked significant discussion across various sectors, the Nepalese government recently presented the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS in the National Assembly. Tabled by the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, the Bill aims to regulate the growing use of social media platforms, holding users and operators accountable for their actions. While the government cites its goal of promoting social goodwill, cultural tolerance, and good governance, there are growing concerns about how this Bill will impact students, particularly in terms of their freedom of expression and online engagement. Understanding the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BSThe bill seeks to establish clear guidelines for social media operators and users, focusing on ensuring a safe and secure digital environment. Among its key provisions, it outlines the following:Licensing for Digital Platforms: Companies or institutions operating digital platforms will need to obtain a license, valid for two years, to run social media sites in Nepal. Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to the revocation of their operating license. Content Regulations: The Bill targets cyberbullying, identity theft, misinformation, hate speech, deep fake videos, and other harmful digital behaviors. It also aims to control the spread of content that could jeopardize national peace, security, or sovereignty. Fines and Penalties: Users who engage in harmful online activities such as trolling, spreading false information, or engaging in online harassment could face fines of up to Rs 500,000. This would affect students who are active on social media platforms, potentially limiting their ability to express themselves freely. How Will This Affect Nepalese Students? Impact on Freedom of ExpressionOne of the main concerns about the bill is its potential effect on freedom of speech and expression. While the governments intention is to curb harmful content, such as hate speech and cyberbullying, there is worry that the broad nature of the regulations could also suppress legitimate expression. For students who use social media to engage in activism, academic discussions, or even personal expression, the fear of unwarranted censorship or punishment could lead to self-censorship and limited discourse online. Education and LearningMany students rely on social media platforms for educational content, online courses, webinars, and knowledge-sharing. However, the new Bills stringent content regulations could restrict access to certain types of content or make platforms overly cautious about the content they allow. Students who use YouTube, LinkedIn, and other social media for professional networking, learning, and career growth might find themselves limited by the need for companies to censor certain types of content to comply with the Bill. Online Privacy and Data SecurityOne of the Bills main selling points is its promise to improve information security, privacy of personal data, and cyber security. While this is an encouraging development, students will need to remain vigilant about their online footprint. The fear of stricter regulations could cause students to reconsider how much personal information they share on social media, which could have implications for those looking to build their online presence, especially for career networking or self-branding. Fines and AccountabilityWith fines of up to Rs 500,000 for users who engage in online activities deemed harmful, students may feel more apprehensive about their interactions on social media. The Bills broad scope, covering actions such as posting, liking, commenting, or tagging with the wrong intention, means that students could be penalized for actions that may seem innocuous or unintentional. This could make students more cautious, reducing their willingness to participate in conversations or share content freely. A Changing Social Media LandscapeThe implementation of the Social Media Council Bill will undoubtedly reshape the way social media operates in Nepal. With stricter regulations on digital platforms, students may find themselves navigating a more controlled online space. This could impact everything from group discussions, student activism, and university-related social media projects to career-building efforts on platforms like LinkedIn. It may also push students to look for new, alternative platforms to communicate or organize, especially if they feel stifled by existing social media regulations. Conclusion: Adapting to a New Digital EnvironmentAs Nepal moves forward with the Social Media Council Bill, students will need to adjust to the new reality of a more regulated digital space. While the intent of the Bill is to foster a safer, more secure online environment, students must stay informed about how the new regulations will affect their digital interactions. Understanding the implications of the Bill will help students protect their rights to freedom of expression, navigate the new rules on digital conduct, and continue using social media platforms in a responsible and creative way.

Our mini research is also one of the most loved workplaces for some of our robotic geeks. We provide drones, 3D printers, and other essentials that our students request for their research. One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha and team have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself. Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at Sunway College Kathmandu March 2021 Intake. Lets have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor. Water Heating: Till Now Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more. There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences. In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? The rise of IoT Internet of Things is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term Internet of Things IoT describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. Theres usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 Temperature-Humidity Sensor Bread Board DS18B20 Water Temperature Sensor Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil  Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, lets understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the projects outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result  Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ides serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometers serial monitor is compared. Acknowledgment I would like to express my warm thank you to Sunway College Kathmandu as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project. Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of Sunway College Kathmandu. I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more. The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway Colleges research lab and beyond that. Posted in student blog Post navigation Next: What to study after 2?

It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more. The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway Colleges research lab and beyond that. Posted in student blog Post navigation Next: What to study after 2?

Posted on September 27, 2023September 27, 2023 by Simoli Desai I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and Im excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, its not that straightforward.  Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, its essential to note that not all genres are following this trend. Heres what I discovered:  Decline in Length: Genres like Childrens and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content.  Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friends data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainmentmedia company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If were going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first well need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Lets start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. Well also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Lets perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friends assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friends aggregations, were limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path datasetsnetflix_data.csv. Lets create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friends data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, its clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While were at it, we dont need information from all of the columns, so lets create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration. Lets put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now were getting somewhere. Weve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Lets try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so lets try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Lets filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as Children, Stand-Up, and Documentaries. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, well also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use. The latter isnt taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as childrens movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we cant know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, youve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas. We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri Posted in student blogLeave a Comment on Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter?

Methodology of developing an automatic water dispenser The methodology consists of the following steps for making this project real: Research and survey: Research is crucial to any project. Before starting this project, first and foremost we researched past works, designs, and projects. Other, comparable devices, such as automatic sanitizers, have been the subject of research. System Design: In system design, we design the device considering its architecture, shape, and size. Also, We also list out the components for the system and plan the system operation and hardware requirements for the project. Additionally, we designed a 3D print. Software Implementation In the software implementation process, we create Arduino code in the Arduino IDE according to the design and upload the code to Arduino for prototyping and testing. Prototyping  Testing In, Prototyping and testing phase, we test the working of the device with a small developed prototype. Device and component integration: After the prototype, we integrate all devices and components per design and code. The materials such as Arduino, an Adjustable IR Sensor, jumper wires, wires, a USB charger, pipe, wiring strips, 12 v chargers, stalls, etc. Data collection  Analysis In this stage, we gather data and analyze it as necessary. From our analysis, we found, that the object should be 56 cm away to sense by the system. And, It takes 3 seconds to get the flavor-infused water from the bucket once the thing is discovered. Result In the result phase, we gather the outcome. As a consequence, we validate if the system operates as intended. Although the dispenser has to be cleaned every day while it is in use. But the good thing is, This project is working and put into action effectively. Conclusion The Automated Panipuri water dispenser is a gadget that senses the Puri and automatically fetches the flavor-infused water. This method can be handy in restaurants, cafes, hotels, etc. Moreover, the gadget has several benefits as we discussed, and is frequently used for automated dispensing in Nepal and other nations too.

Data Science and Artificial Intelligence  A career that never ends IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor by Sabin Shrestha Posted on August 5, 2022November 11, 2022 by admin At Sunway College, we have a dedicated research lab Sunway College Research Lab where we focus on experimenting and researching different IoT-based devices. Our mini research is also one of the most loved workplaces for some of our robotic geeks. We provide drones, 3D printers, and other essentials that our students request for their research. One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha and team have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself. Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at Sunway College Kathmandu March 2021 Intake. Lets have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor. Water Heating: Till Now Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more. There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences. In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? The rise of IoT Internet of Things is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term Internet of Things IoT describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. Theres usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 Temperature-Humidity Sensor Bread Board DS18B20 Water Temperature Sensor Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil  Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, lets understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the projects outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result  Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ides serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometers serial monitor is compared. Acknowledgment I would like to express my warm thank you to Sunway College Kathmandu as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project. Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of Sunway College Kathmandu. I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more.

https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog/#primary,student blog Archives - Sunway College Kathmandu,,,"Category: student blog Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter? Posted on September 27, 2023September 27, 2023 by Simoli Desai I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and Im excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, its not that straightforward.  Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, its essential to note that not all genres are following this trend. Heres what I discovered:  Decline in Length: Genres like Childrens and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content.  Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friends data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainmentmedia company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If were going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first well need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Lets start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. Well also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Lets perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friends assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friends aggregations, were limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path datasetsnetflix_data.csv. Lets create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friends data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, its clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While were at it, we dont need information from all of the columns, so lets create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration. Lets put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now were getting somewhere. Weve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Lets try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so lets try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Lets filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as Children, Stand-Up, and Documentaries. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, well also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use. The latter isnt taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as childrens movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we cant know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, youve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas. We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri Posted in student blogLeave a Comment on Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter?

Methodology of developing an automatic water dispenser The methodology consists of the following steps for making this project real: Research and survey: Research is crucial to any project. Before starting this project, first and foremost we researched past works, designs, and projects. Other, comparable devices, such as automatic sanitizers, have been the subject of research. System Design: In system design, we design the device considering its architecture, shape, and size. Also, We also list out the components for the system and plan the system operation and hardware requirements for the project. Additionally, we designed a 3D print. Software Implementation In the software implementation process, we create Arduino code in the Arduino IDE according to the design and upload the code to Arduino for prototyping and testing. Prototyping  Testing In, Prototyping and testing phase, we test the working of the device with a small developed prototype. Device and component integration: After the prototype, we integrate all devices and components per design and code. The materials such as Arduino, an Adjustable IR Sensor, jumper wires, wires, a USB charger, pipe, wiring strips, 12 v chargers, stalls, etc. Data collection  Analysis In this stage, we gather data and analyze it as necessary. From our analysis, we found, that the object should be 56 cm away to sense by the system. And, It takes 3 seconds to get the flavor-infused water from the bucket once the thing is discovered. Result In the result phase, we gather the outcome. As a consequence, we validate if the system operates as intended. Although the dispenser has to be cleaned every day while it is in use. But the good thing is, This project is working and put into action effectively. Conclusion The Automated Panipuri water dispenser is a gadget that senses the Puri and automatically fetches the flavor-infused water. This method can be handy in restaurants, cafes, hotels, etc. Moreover, the gadget has several benefits as we discussed, and is frequently used for automated dispensing in Nepal and other nations too.

Data Science and Artificial Intelligence  A career that never ends IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor by Sabin Shrestha Posted on August 5, 2022November 11, 2022 by admin At Sunway College, we have a dedicated research lab Sunway College Research Lab where we focus on experimenting and researching different IoT-based devices. Our mini research is also one of the most loved workplaces for some of our robotic geeks. We provide drones, 3D printers, and other essentials that our students request for their research. One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha and team have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself. Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at Sunway College Kathmandu March 2021 Intake. Lets have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor. Water Heating: Till Now Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more. There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences. In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? The rise of IoT Internet of Things is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term Internet of Things IoT describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. Theres usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 Temperature-Humidity Sensor Bread Board DS18B20 Water Temperature Sensor Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil  Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, lets understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the projects outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result  Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ides serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometers serial monitor is compared. Acknowledgment I would like to express my warm thank you to Sunway College Kathmandu as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project. Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of Sunway College Kathmandu. I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more. The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway Colleges research lab and beyond that.

https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter/,Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter?,2023-09-27T11:44:17+00:00,What are your thoughts on these trends in Netflix movie lengths? Do you think these changes are primarily driven by viewer preferences?,"Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter? Posted on September 27, 2023September 27, 2023 by Simoli Desai I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and Im excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, its not that straightforward.  Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, its essential to note that not all genres are following this trend. Heres what I discovered:  Decline in Length: Genres like Childrens and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content.  Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friends data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainmentmedia company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If were going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first well need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Lets start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. Well also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Lets perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friends assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friends aggregations, were limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path datasetsnetflix_data.csv. Lets create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friends data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, its clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While were at it, we dont need information from all of the columns, so lets create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration. Lets put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now were getting somewhere. Weve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Lets try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so lets try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Lets filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as Children, Stand-Up, and Documentaries. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, well also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use. The latter isnt taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as childrens movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we cant know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, youve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas. We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri Posted in student blog Post navigation Previous: Partner Institutions with DigiSchool  UK CollegesNext: Study in Nepal with ECAN SoftEd IT Scholarship Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

No, its not clickbait. It is indeed true that you have this opportunity for up to 100 IELTS scholarships to study BSc Hons Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence based on your IELTS score. If you have successfully completed your 12th grade exam along with the IELTS International English Language Proficiency Test, then you are a prospective student to receive up to 100 IELTS scholarship based on your score. So, without wasting any seconds, apply now and grab this opportunity. The score part is described in detail below, so keep reading. Also, I will be referring to the IELTS score-based scholarships simply as IELTS scholarships. So, dont get confused; it is an IELTS score-based scholarship. If your to-be career profile says, I want to: study in my home country. study in my home country with a foreign degree. study a bachelors degree in computer science and artificial intelligence. study a bachelors degree in computer science and artificial intelligence with a professional paid placement. study computer science and artificial intelligence in Nepal with foreign degree and a 9-month paid placement. Have IELTS scholarships .. ahem what? Congratulations! We are a match. But how does it match? IELTS scholarships and Artificial Intelligence. Am I missing something here? Please allow me to put your misunderstanding to rest. First, you must understand the relationship between our computer science and artificial intelligence course and the English Proficiency Test. Our purpose The purpose of giving the IELTS scholarships is to assist and motivate individuals who have shown they are proficient in the English language and who wish to pursue further education. By taking this action, the college wants to encourage you to finish your degrees domestically rather than abroad. The scholarship amount will be based on the students IELTS scores, as follows: IELTS scoresIELTS scholarships on college semester fees6, with each band score of 5.530 scholarship6.5, with each band score of 640 scholarship 7, with each band score of 6.550 scholarship7.5, with each band score of 760 scholarship8, with each band score of 7.570 scholarship8.5, with each band score of 880 scholarship9, with each band score of 8.5100 scholarshipIELTS scholarships on the basis of IELTS score I am guessing you are wondering about the fee structure too. Whats more, you must have taken and passed the IELTS test within the last two years, so you must present documentation of your results in order to be eligible for the scholarship. The scholarship will be awarded to a small number of students and will be based on both academic excellence and financial need. Why English proficiency test? Because this is a UK degree and the criteria are established by Birmingham City University BCU. I want to be clear about why you should care about having strong academic English before I continue. Im assuming youve already completed an English proficiency test, so you already have a basic understanding of its significance. Firstly, Academic English is the language used in academic contexts including colleges, research facilities, and business conventions. It is a formal and specialized form of communication that is important for the academic and professional settings.

Posted in UncategorizedLeave a Comment on 10 Reasons to Study Data Science Generative AI: Pioneering the Future! Posted on July 30, 2023July 30, 2023 by admin Generative AI revolutionizes the creative process by allowing humans to supervise while machines generate. This shift relieves us from tedious, risky, and challenging tasks, enabling us to concentrate on the core aspects of our work: vision, ideas, and purpose. It represents a transformative change in the future of employment. Importance of Generative AI Generative AI, like photography and celluloid film, represents an incredible creative revolution. It reduces the necessity for creative skill in painting or singing, just as photography emancipated us from relying entirely on artists to depict the truth. The influence of Generative AI goes beyond creativity, giving rapid access to clear information and the automatic development of varied material such as news stories, product descriptions, bespoke designs, music, visual effects, and more. It is redefining not only specialized professions as well as our view of work, as AI models increasingly aid with repetitive or computational activities in the manufacturing process. How is Generative AI different from other AI? In contrast to other forms of artificial intelligence, generative AI focuses on producing new material, whereas discriminative AI classifies existing data. Generative AI is used for picture production, video synthesis, language generation, and music composition. It is one of the subcategories of artificial intelligence that encompasses various activities done by AI systems. Reactive machines for self-driving cars, limited memory AI for weather forecasting, theory of mind for virtual customer assistance, narrow AI for personalized product suggestions in e-commerce, supervised learning for object identification, unsupervised learning for fraud detection in banking, and reinforcement learning for teaching machines to play games are all examples of these tasks. Generative AI encompasses several of these areas and continues to grow, with its primary goal being the production of new material, whether writing, graphics, or product suggestions. How Generative AI works? To recognize patterns and produce new results, generative AI employs techniques such as neural networks and deep learning algorithms. It learns the basic principles guiding the content by studying a vast dataset. It generates fresh data by sampling from a previously learned distribution. The model refines the output to fit the desired outcome through a process known as inference, making it more realistic and aligned with user preferences. Generative AI Models 1. Natural Language Model Natural Language Model is the most well-known model of Generative AI, with ChatGPT making headlines. The majority of the excitement around text-based Generative AI is centered on a model known as GPT-3. Its a language model created by OpenAI, a research group dedicated to the development and promotion of friendly AI. For example, while computers cannot understand language in the same way that humans can, natural language technologies are becoming more effective at identifying the context and meaning of phrases and words and converting them into suitable responsesand actions. 2. Generative Adversarial Networks GANs Generative Adversarial Networks GANs are a well-known form of Generative AI. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator that work together to enhance the generators ability to generate realistic data. Over time, the generator improves its capacity to synthesize lifelike data, resulting in the creation of new items, assets, faces, and even people. GANs can be utilized for various applications, including generating natural features such as lightning, leaves, roots, eyes, and flowers, as well as seamlessly integrating humans with nature. Furthermore, in the context of financial fraud detection, GAN models can generate synthetic fraudulent transactions to train fraud detection algorithms. 3. VAE and Anomaly Detection Variational Autoencoders VAE are a major model used for anomaly identification. It entails training the model on a collection of normal data and then utilizing it to detect occurrences that deviate from the norm. VAE has applications in a variety of fields, including financial fraud detection, discovering defects in manufacturing processes, and detecting network breaches. For example, Google has used VAE to identify network attacks. Future Prediction Generative AI will continue to play a critical role in computer graphics, animation, and 3D modeling in the gaming, film, and marketing industries. It will also be employed in the next decade or so to improve virtual assistants and chatbots natural language understanding, allowing them to conduct complicated discussions. In the future, generative AI will help to create realistic simulations in sectors like architecture and engineering, create new materials and products in manufacturing and textile design, and aid in natural language production for news articles, novels, and movie screenplays. Conclusion In terms of utility and predictability, generative AI is similar to a camera, acting as a powerful instrument in the hands of people. Just like a camera performs reliably, generative AI follows the same pattern each time it is used. It enables people to use their skills to generate content, develop new solutions, and explore creative possibilities. Users may leverage the potential of generative AI to improve productivity, accelerate improvements, and stimulate discoveries by understanding and utilizing its consistent nature.

Posted on July 26, 2023January 26, 2024 by admin Threads is a social networking software developed by Meta, which created Instagram and Facebook. Threads allow you to see a feed of everything thats going on with your friends or persons youre interested in. You may also upload messages, text, images, and videos. You might also respond to or like messages. Threads Vs Twitter Twitter has increased the number of advertisements that appear after one out of every five postings. An individual has a large number of bot accounts and improper accounts that need to be detected. Twitter charges for verification, risking fake paid Elon Musk accounts. Limited daily tweets can be viewed unless users pay to increase the limit. Threads aims to counter negative sentiment toward Twitter meta, explicitly stating no monetization until the app hits a billion users. How do Threads work? Theyve adjusted it so that everyone must have an Instagram account before theyre able to sign up, which has significantly reduced the degree of Bot activity. Because its linked to your Instagram account, you wont have to pay for verification, and it will automatically transfer from your Instagram to your Threads account. Threads unexpected buzz makes it seem like everyone is already there, a challenge for new platforms. When one of your Instagram followers signs up for Threads, they automatically follow you, giving the user a huge boost in enthusiasm. As a result, threads seem like this New Haven is like a fresh start on Twitter. Because of his superb timing and some big-brain marketing, Mark Zuckerberg has become the new Peoples Choice hero. Theyve also figured out how to develop an enormous fear of missing out among those on the outside. Registering quickly for a Threads account earns you a rating, akin to a race assessment. What makes Twitter differ from Threads? Threads vs Twitter Twitters unique focus on news fosters real-time discussions, allowing users to engage and learn about global events and perspectives. The app Threads faces a data issue, as it currently does not comply with the strict data laws of the European Union. Automatic Status Sharing The software also introduces the notion of automated status sharing, which allows users to automatically share their activities and locations. Threads intelligently recognize and share information about a users current status, such as location, movement, or even the music they are listening to, using powerful AI algorithms. While these capabilities may raise privacy concerns for some users, the app assures that users control information sharing, emphasizing transparency and consent. Conclusion Threads intended to debut in a minimal, stable state for V1, resembling Twitter with deliberate Instagram design aspects. Moreover, it is appropriately called since users have begun to refer to Threads as strings of messages, and its straightforward, with your newsfeed consisting of individuals you follow and those you dont. It nails the basicsvisually appealing, runs smoothly, almost bug-freemaking it a less overwhelming alternative to Twitter.

Posted in UncategorizedLeave a Comment on All you need to know about BSc Hons Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Scope  Placements  Career How does the For You algorithm work in TikTok? Posted on October 13, 2022June 9, 2023 by admin Have you ever wondered how the TikTok algorithm work? Let us review and understand. TikTok is addictive. It is so addictive that 9 out of 10 users on TikTok use it daily for hours. How do we spend hours on TikTok, even if its a short-content platform? Lets understand how the TikTok For You algorithm works. We will also cover how the basic recommendation algorithm works. Working of TikTok For You Page Recommendation Algorithm Before going in depth on how the TikTok algorithm works, let us understand the metadata. Metadata is the data that provides information about the data. This data helps identify and categorize the content for various backend purposes. Metadata of TikTok Videos Hashtags Hashtags are a few phrases attached to the end of the captions so they can help the algorithm understand the content type. The video uploader usually chooses this. Hashtags are better for a new content creator because they help TikTok identify the type of content theyre uploading. Music TikToks are frequently associated with music. TikTok made a significant move by using copyrighted music as a streaming platform, allowing creators to attach sounds without fear of copyright infringement. The music we choose for a TikTok video categorizes it as well, making it one of the more important pieces of metadata. Content-Duration TikTok is slowly increasing its video content duration limit. The platform started with a 15-second video uploaded over 10 minutes today. The length of the video also categorizes it, making it metadata for a TikTok video. Creator The creator uploading the content is by far the most critical metadata to categorize TikTok videos. Similarly, other metadata such as uploaded time, location, date, and video quality are a few other examples of metadata for a TikTok video. Consumer Ratings on TikTok When a video is released, TikTok usually sends it to all of its active users at once, who are usually chosen based on the metadata of the video that they are watching. Implicit Ratings Implicit ratings are ratings that occur as a result of behavior and cannot be faked by the user. For example, ordering a product from an online store. A few implicit ratings for TikTok videos are: View Time: During the initial video shoot, TikTok closely monitors the average watch duration of the video. There is a trend of looping a TikTok video so that the end can be unnoticed; the clever creator does it so that the watch duration exceeds the actual content duration, signaling the TikTok algorithm. Video Skips: A video viewer usually skips a video when they dont like it. This can be an important signal for TikTok to stop recommending the video that has been skipped and instead recommend some other content category. Profile Visit When consumers like the video, they usually visit the creators profile. This can count as an implicit rating as the user is indicating that they like the creator and want to consume similar content. Explicit Ratings Explicit ratings are the ratings that the user explicitly creates, which means theres some effort in creating explicit ratings. For example, liking a TikTok video A few explicit ratings for TikTok videos are: Likes: The user usually double-taps when they like the content, this helps to increase the likes count for a video and helps the algorithm. Comments: A comment on a video can act as a powerful explicit rating if there is more time and effort required to do so. Shares: Shares are also one of the most powerful explicit ratings as it is one of the rarest ratings, and parallelly, it also creates more exposure for the content. How TikTok algorithm work in recommended videos? As we have understood all the following terms, now we can understand how TikTok algorithm work to recommended videos. Step 1: The user uploads the video, and TikTok takes a few minutes to understand the content based on metadata. Step 2: TikTok distributes the video to a few active users in order to collect preliminary consumption data. Step 3: TikTok typically suggests the video to users who are watching other similarly category videos based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video. Step 4: Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. In conclusion, TikTok is a video-editing app that sends videos to a few active users to collect initial consumption results. Based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video, TikTok usually recommends the content to users who are consuming similar videos. Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. A message from the Sunway Social media and its uses have spread like wildfire lately.

Posted in UncategorizedLeave a Comment on 10 Reasons to Study Data Science Generative AI: Pioneering the Future! Posted on July 30, 2023July 30, 2023 by admin Generative AI revolutionizes the creative process by allowing humans to supervise while machines generate. This shift relieves us from tedious, risky, and challenging tasks, enabling us to concentrate on the core aspects of our work: vision, ideas, and purpose. It represents a transformative change in the future of employment. Importance of Generative AI Generative AI, like photography and celluloid film, represents an incredible creative revolution. It reduces the necessity for creative skill in painting or singing, just as photography emancipated us from relying entirely on artists to depict the truth. The influence of Generative AI goes beyond creativity, giving rapid access to clear information and the automatic development of varied material such as news stories, product descriptions, bespoke designs, music, visual effects, and more. It is redefining not only specialized professions as well as our view of work, as AI models increasingly aid with repetitive or computational activities in the manufacturing process. How is Generative AI different from other AI? In contrast to other forms of artificial intelligence, generative AI focuses on producing new material, whereas discriminative AI classifies existing data. Generative AI is used for picture production, video synthesis, language generation, and music composition. It is one of the subcategories of artificial intelligence that encompasses various activities done by AI systems. Reactive machines for self-driving cars, limited memory AI for weather forecasting, theory of mind for virtual customer assistance, narrow AI for personalized product suggestions in e-commerce, supervised learning for object identification, unsupervised learning for fraud detection in banking, and reinforcement learning for teaching machines to play games are all examples of these tasks. Generative AI encompasses several of these areas and continues to grow, with its primary goal being the production of new material, whether writing, graphics, or product suggestions. How Generative AI works? To recognize patterns and produce new results, generative AI employs techniques such as neural networks and deep learning algorithms. It learns the basic principles guiding the content by studying a vast dataset. It generates fresh data by sampling from a previously learned distribution. The model refines the output to fit the desired outcome through a process known as inference, making it more realistic and aligned with user preferences. Generative AI Models 1. Natural Language Model Natural Language Model is the most well-known model of Generative AI, with ChatGPT making headlines. The majority of the excitement around text-based Generative AI is centered on a model known as GPT-3. Its a language model created by OpenAI, a research group dedicated to the development and promotion of friendly AI. For example, while computers cannot understand language in the same way that humans can, natural language technologies are becoming more effective at identifying the context and meaning of phrases and words and converting them into suitable responsesand actions. 2. Generative Adversarial Networks GANs Generative Adversarial Networks GANs are a well-known form of Generative AI. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator that work together to enhance the generators ability to generate realistic data. Over time, the generator improves its capacity to synthesize lifelike data, resulting in the creation of new items, assets, faces, and even people. GANs can be utilized for various applications, including generating natural features such as lightning, leaves, roots, eyes, and flowers, as well as seamlessly integrating humans with nature. Furthermore, in the context of financial fraud detection, GAN models can generate synthetic fraudulent transactions to train fraud detection algorithms. 3. VAE and Anomaly Detection Variational Autoencoders VAE are a major model used for anomaly identification. It entails training the model on a collection of normal data and then utilizing it to detect occurrences that deviate from the norm. VAE has applications in a variety of fields, including financial fraud detection, discovering defects in manufacturing processes, and detecting network breaches. For example, Google has used VAE to identify network attacks. Future Prediction Generative AI will continue to play a critical role in computer graphics, animation, and 3D modeling in the gaming, film, and marketing industries. It will also be employed in the next decade or so to improve virtual assistants and chatbots natural language understanding, allowing them to conduct complicated discussions. In the future, generative AI will help to create realistic simulations in sectors like architecture and engineering, create new materials and products in manufacturing and textile design, and aid in natural language production for news articles, novels, and movie screenplays. Conclusion In terms of utility and predictability, generative AI is similar to a camera, acting as a powerful instrument in the hands of people. Just like a camera performs reliably, generative AI follows the same pattern each time it is used. It enables people to use their skills to generate content, develop new solutions, and explore creative possibilities. Users may leverage the potential of generative AI to improve productivity, accelerate improvements, and stimulate discoveries by understanding and utilizing its consistent nature.

Posted on July 26, 2023January 26, 2024 by admin Threads is a social networking software developed by Meta, which created Instagram and Facebook. Threads allow you to see a feed of everything thats going on with your friends or persons youre interested in. You may also upload messages, text, images, and videos. You might also respond to or like messages. Threads Vs Twitter Twitter has increased the number of advertisements that appear after one out of every five postings. An individual has a large number of bot accounts and improper accounts that need to be detected. Twitter charges for verification, risking fake paid Elon Musk accounts. Limited daily tweets can be viewed unless users pay to increase the limit. Threads aims to counter negative sentiment toward Twitter meta, explicitly stating no monetization until the app hits a billion users. How do Threads work? Theyve adjusted it so that everyone must have an Instagram account before theyre able to sign up, which has significantly reduced the degree of Bot activity. Because its linked to your Instagram account, you wont have to pay for verification, and it will automatically transfer from your Instagram to your Threads account. Threads unexpected buzz makes it seem like everyone is already there, a challenge for new platforms. When one of your Instagram followers signs up for Threads, they automatically follow you, giving the user a huge boost in enthusiasm. As a result, threads seem like this New Haven is like a fresh start on Twitter. Because of his superb timing and some big-brain marketing, Mark Zuckerberg has become the new Peoples Choice hero. Theyve also figured out how to develop an enormous fear of missing out among those on the outside. Registering quickly for a Threads account earns you a rating, akin to a race assessment. What makes Twitter differ from Threads? Threads vs Twitter Twitters unique focus on news fosters real-time discussions, allowing users to engage and learn about global events and perspectives. The app Threads faces a data issue, as it currently does not comply with the strict data laws of the European Union. Automatic Status Sharing The software also introduces the notion of automated status sharing, which allows users to automatically share their activities and locations. Threads intelligently recognize and share information about a users current status, such as location, movement, or even the music they are listening to, using powerful AI algorithms. While these capabilities may raise privacy concerns for some users, the app assures that users control information sharing, emphasizing transparency and consent. Conclusion Threads intended to debut in a minimal, stable state for V1, resembling Twitter with deliberate Instagram design aspects. Moreover, it is appropriately called since users have begun to refer to Threads as strings of messages, and its straightforward, with your newsfeed consisting of individuals you follow and those you dont. It nails the basicsvisually appealing, runs smoothly, almost bug-freemaking it a less overwhelming alternative to Twitter.

Posted in UncategorizedLeave a Comment on All you need to know about BSc Hons Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Scope  Placements  Career How does the For You algorithm work in TikTok? Posted on October 13, 2022June 9, 2023 by admin Have you ever wondered how the TikTok algorithm work? Let us review and understand. TikTok is addictive. It is so addictive that 9 out of 10 users on TikTok use it daily for hours. How do we spend hours on TikTok, even if its a short-content platform? Lets understand how the TikTok For You algorithm works. We will also cover how the basic recommendation algorithm works. Working of TikTok For You Page Recommendation Algorithm Before going in depth on how the TikTok algorithm works, let us understand the metadata. Metadata is the data that provides information about the data. This data helps identify and categorize the content for various backend purposes. Metadata of TikTok Videos Hashtags Hashtags are a few phrases attached to the end of the captions so they can help the algorithm understand the content type. The video uploader usually chooses this. Hashtags are better for a new content creator because they help TikTok identify the type of content theyre uploading. Music TikToks are frequently associated with music. TikTok made a significant move by using copyrighted music as a streaming platform, allowing creators to attach sounds without fear of copyright infringement. The music we choose for a TikTok video categorizes it as well, making it one of the more important pieces of metadata. Content-Duration TikTok is slowly increasing its video content duration limit. The platform started with a 15-second video uploaded over 10 minutes today. The length of the video also categorizes it, making it metadata for a TikTok video. Creator The creator uploading the content is by far the most critical metadata to categorize TikTok videos. Similarly, other metadata such as uploaded time, location, date, and video quality are a few other examples of metadata for a TikTok video. Consumer Ratings on TikTok When a video is released, TikTok usually sends it to all of its active users at once, who are usually chosen based on the metadata of the video that they are watching. Implicit Ratings Implicit ratings are ratings that occur as a result of behavior and cannot be faked by the user. For example, ordering a product from an online store. A few implicit ratings for TikTok videos are: View Time: During the initial video shoot, TikTok closely monitors the average watch duration of the video. There is a trend of looping a TikTok video so that the end can be unnoticed; the clever creator does it so that the watch duration exceeds the actual content duration, signaling the TikTok algorithm. Video Skips: A video viewer usually skips a video when they dont like it. This can be an important signal for TikTok to stop recommending the video that has been skipped and instead recommend some other content category. Profile Visit When consumers like the video, they usually visit the creators profile. This can count as an implicit rating as the user is indicating that they like the creator and want to consume similar content. Explicit Ratings Explicit ratings are the ratings that the user explicitly creates, which means theres some effort in creating explicit ratings. For example, liking a TikTok video A few explicit ratings for TikTok videos are: Likes: The user usually double-taps when they like the content, this helps to increase the likes count for a video and helps the algorithm. Comments: A comment on a video can act as a powerful explicit rating if there is more time and effort required to do so. Shares: Shares are also one of the most powerful explicit ratings as it is one of the rarest ratings, and parallelly, it also creates more exposure for the content. How TikTok algorithm work in recommended videos? As we have understood all the following terms, now we can understand how TikTok algorithm work to recommended videos. Step 1: The user uploads the video, and TikTok takes a few minutes to understand the content based on metadata. Step 2: TikTok distributes the video to a few active users in order to collect preliminary consumption data. Step 3: TikTok typically suggests the video to users who are watching other similarly category videos based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video. Step 4: Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. In conclusion, TikTok is a video-editing app that sends videos to a few active users to collect initial consumption results. Based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video, TikTok usually recommends the content to users who are consuming similar videos. Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. A message from the Sunway Social media and its uses have spread like wildfire lately.

https://sunway.edu.np/2025/02/,February 2025 - Sunway College Kathmandu,,,"Month: February 2025 How Nepals Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS Could Impact Students: A Closer Look Posted on February 21, 2025February 21, 2025 by admin In a move that has sparked significant discussion across various sectors, the Nepalese government recently presented the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS in the National Assembly. Tabled by the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, the Bill aims to regulate the growing use of social media platforms, holding users and operators accountable for their actions. While the government cites its goal of promoting social goodwill, cultural tolerance, and good governance, there are growing concerns about how this Bill will impact students, particularly in terms of their freedom of expression and online engagement. Understanding the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BSThe bill seeks to establish clear guidelines for social media operators and users, focusing on ensuring a safe and secure digital environment. Among its key provisions, it outlines the following:Licensing for Digital Platforms: Companies or institutions operating digital platforms will need to obtain a license, valid for two years, to run social media sites in Nepal. Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to the revocation of their operating license. Content Regulations: The Bill targets cyberbullying, identity theft, misinformation, hate speech, deep fake videos, and other harmful digital behaviors. It also aims to control the spread of content that could jeopardize national peace, security, or sovereignty. Fines and Penalties: Users who engage in harmful online activities such as trolling, spreading false information, or engaging in online harassment could face fines of up to Rs 500,000. This would affect students who are active on social media platforms, potentially limiting their ability to express themselves freely. How Will This Affect Nepalese Students? Impact on Freedom of ExpressionOne of the main concerns about the bill is its potential effect on freedom of speech and expression. While the governments intention is to curb harmful content, such as hate speech and cyberbullying, there is worry that the broad nature of the regulations could also suppress legitimate expression. For students who use social media to engage in activism, academic discussions, or even personal expression, the fear of unwarranted censorship or punishment could lead to self-censorship and limited discourse online. Education and LearningMany students rely on social media platforms for educational content, online courses, webinars, and knowledge-sharing. However, the new Bills stringent content regulations could restrict access to certain types of content or make platforms overly cautious about the content they allow. Students who use YouTube, LinkedIn, and other social media for professional networking, learning, and career growth might find themselves limited by the need for companies to censor certain types of content to comply with the Bill. Online Privacy and Data SecurityOne of the Bills main selling points is its promise to improve information security, privacy of personal data, and cyber security. While this is an encouraging development, students will need to remain vigilant about their online footprint. The fear of stricter regulations could cause students to reconsider how much personal information they share on social media, which could have implications for those looking to build their online presence, especially for career networking or self-branding. Fines and AccountabilityWith fines of up to Rs 500,000 for users who engage in online activities deemed harmful, students may feel more apprehensive about their interactions on social media. The Bills broad scope, covering actions such as posting, liking, commenting, or tagging with the wrong intention, means that students could be penalized for actions that may seem innocuous or unintentional. This could make students more cautious, reducing their willingness to participate in conversations or share content freely. A Changing Social Media LandscapeThe implementation of the Social Media Council Bill will undoubtedly reshape the way social media operates in Nepal. With stricter regulations on digital platforms, students may find themselves navigating a more controlled online space. This could impact everything from group discussions, student activism, and university-related social media projects to career-building efforts on platforms like LinkedIn. It may also push students to look for new, alternative platforms to communicate or organize, especially if they feel stifled by existing social media regulations.

https://sunway.edu.np/2025/02/#primary,February 2025 - Sunway College Kathmandu,,,"Month: February 2025 How Nepals Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS Could Impact Students: A Closer Look Posted on February 21, 2025February 21, 2025 by admin In a move that has sparked significant discussion across various sectors, the Nepalese government recently presented the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS in the National Assembly. Tabled by the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, the Bill aims to regulate the growing use of social media platforms, holding users and operators accountable for their actions. While the government cites its goal of promoting social goodwill, cultural tolerance, and good governance, there are growing concerns about how this Bill will impact students, particularly in terms of their freedom of expression and online engagement. Understanding the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BSThe bill seeks to establish clear guidelines for social media operators and users, focusing on ensuring a safe and secure digital environment. Among its key provisions, it outlines the following:Licensing for Digital Platforms: Companies or institutions operating digital platforms will need to obtain a license, valid for two years, to run social media sites in Nepal. Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to the revocation of their operating license. Content Regulations: The Bill targets cyberbullying, identity theft, misinformation, hate speech, deep fake videos, and other harmful digital behaviors. It also aims to control the spread of content that could jeopardize national peace, security, or sovereignty. Fines and Penalties: Users who engage in harmful online activities such as trolling, spreading false information, or engaging in online harassment could face fines of up to Rs 500,000. This would affect students who are active on social media platforms, potentially limiting their ability to express themselves freely. How Will This Affect Nepalese Students? Impact on Freedom of ExpressionOne of the main concerns about the bill is its potential effect on freedom of speech and expression. While the governments intention is to curb harmful content, such as hate speech and cyberbullying, there is worry that the broad nature of the regulations could also suppress legitimate expression. For students who use social media to engage in activism, academic discussions, or even personal expression, the fear of unwarranted censorship or punishment could lead to self-censorship and limited discourse online. Education and LearningMany students rely on social media platforms for educational content, online courses, webinars, and knowledge-sharing. However, the new Bills stringent content regulations could restrict access to certain types of content or make platforms overly cautious about the content they allow. Students who use YouTube, LinkedIn, and other social media for professional networking, learning, and career growth might find themselves limited by the need for companies to censor certain types of content to comply with the Bill. Online Privacy and Data SecurityOne of the Bills main selling points is its promise to improve information security, privacy of personal data, and cyber security. While this is an encouraging development, students will need to remain vigilant about their online footprint. The fear of stricter regulations could cause students to reconsider how much personal information they share on social media, which could have implications for those looking to build their online presence, especially for career networking or self-branding. Fines and AccountabilityWith fines of up to Rs 500,000 for users who engage in online activities deemed harmful, students may feel more apprehensive about their interactions on social media. The Bills broad scope, covering actions such as posting, liking, commenting, or tagging with the wrong intention, means that students could be penalized for actions that may seem innocuous or unintentional. This could make students more cautious, reducing their willingness to participate in conversations or share content freely. A Changing Social Media LandscapeThe implementation of the Social Media Council Bill will undoubtedly reshape the way social media operates in Nepal. With stricter regulations on digital platforms, students may find themselves navigating a more controlled online space. This could impact everything from group discussions, student activism, and university-related social media projects to career-building efforts on platforms like LinkedIn. It may also push students to look for new, alternative platforms to communicate or organize, especially if they feel stifled by existing social media regulations. Conclusion: Adapting to a New Digital EnvironmentAs Nepal moves forward with the Social Media Council Bill, students will need to adjust to the new reality of a more regulated digital space. While the intent of the Bill is to foster a safer, more secure online environment, students must stay informed about how the new regulations will affect their digital interactions. Understanding the implications of the Bill will help students protect their rights to freedom of expression, navigate the new rules on digital conduct, and continue using social media platforms in a responsible and creative way.

https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09/,September 2023 - Sunway College Kathmandu,,,"Month: September 2023 Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter? Posted on September 27, 2023September 27, 2023 by Simoli Desai I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and Im excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, its not that straightforward.  Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, its essential to note that not all genres are following this trend. Heres what I discovered:  Decline in Length: Genres like Childrens and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content.  Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friends data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainmentmedia company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If were going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first well need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Lets start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. Well also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Lets perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friends assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friends aggregations, were limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path datasetsnetflix_data.csv. Lets create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friends data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, its clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While were at it, we dont need information from all of the columns, so lets create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration. Lets put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now were getting somewhere. Weve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Lets try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so lets try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Lets filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as Children, Stand-Up, and Documentaries. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, well also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use. The latter isnt taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as childrens movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we cant know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, youve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas. We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri Posted in student blogLeave a Comment on Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter?

https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter/#respond,Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter?,2023-09-27T11:44:17+00:00,What are your thoughts on these trends in Netflix movie lengths? Do you think these changes are primarily driven by viewer preferences?,"Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter? Posted on September 27, 2023September 27, 2023 by Simoli Desai I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and Im excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, its not that straightforward.  Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, its essential to note that not all genres are following this trend. Heres what I discovered:  Decline in Length: Genres like Childrens and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content.  Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friends data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainmentmedia company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If were going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first well need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Lets start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. Well also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Lets perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friends assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friends aggregations, were limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path datasetsnetflix_data.csv. Lets create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friends data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, its clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While were at it, we dont need information from all of the columns, so lets create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration. Lets put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now were getting somewhere. Weve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Lets try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so lets try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Lets filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as Children, Stand-Up, and Documentaries. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, well also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use. The latter isnt taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as childrens movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we cant know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, youve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas. We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri Posted in student blog Post navigation Previous: Partner Institutions with DigiSchool  UK CollegesNext: Study in Nepal with ECAN SoftEd IT Scholarship Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

Threads allow you to see a feed of everything thats going on with your friends or persons youre interested in. You may also upload messages, text, images, and videos. You might also respond to or like messages. Threads Vs Twitter Twitter has increased the number of advertisements that appear after one out of every five postings. An individual has a large number of bot accounts and improper accounts that need to be detected. Twitter charges for verification, risking fake paid Elon Musk accounts. Limited daily tweets can be viewed unless users pay to increase the limit. Threads aims to counter negative sentiment toward Twitter meta, explicitly stating no monetization until the app hits a billion users. How do Threads work? Theyve adjusted it so that everyone must have an Instagram account before theyre able to sign up, which has significantly reduced the degree of Bot activity. Because its linked to your Instagram account, you wont have to pay for verification, and it will automatically transfer from your Instagram to your Threads account. Threads unexpected buzz makes it seem like everyone is already there, a challenge for new platforms. When one of your Instagram followers signs up for Threads, they automatically follow you, giving the user a huge boost in enthusiasm. As a result, threads seem like this New Haven is like a fresh start on Twitter. Because of his superb timing and some big-brain marketing, Mark Zuckerberg has become the new Peoples Choice hero. Theyve also figured out how to develop an enormous fear of missing out among those on the outside. Registering quickly for a Threads account earns you a rating, akin to a race assessment. What makes Twitter differ from Threads? Threads vs Twitter Twitters unique focus on news fosters real-time discussions, allowing users to engage and learn about global events and perspectives. The app Threads faces a data issue, as it currently does not comply with the strict data laws of the European Union. Automatic Status Sharing The software also introduces the notion of automated status sharing, which allows users to automatically share their activities and locations.

Posted on July 26, 2023January 26, 2024 by admin Threads is a social networking software developed by Meta, which created Instagram and Facebook. Threads allow you to see a feed of everything thats going on with your friends or persons youre interested in. You may also upload messages, text, images, and videos. You might also respond to or like messages. Threads Vs Twitter Twitter has increased the number of advertisements that appear after one out of every five postings. An individual has a large number of bot accounts and improper accounts that need to be detected. Twitter charges for verification, risking fake paid Elon Musk accounts. Limited daily tweets can be viewed unless users pay to increase the limit. Threads aims to counter negative sentiment toward Twitter meta, explicitly stating no monetization until the app hits a billion users. How do Threads work? Theyve adjusted it so that everyone must have an Instagram account before theyre able to sign up, which has significantly reduced the degree of Bot activity. Because its linked to your Instagram account, you wont have to pay for verification, and it will automatically transfer from your Instagram to your Threads account. Threads unexpected buzz makes it seem like everyone is already there, a challenge for new platforms. When one of your Instagram followers signs up for Threads, they automatically follow you, giving the user a huge boost in enthusiasm. As a result, threads seem like this New Haven is like a fresh start on Twitter. Because of his superb timing and some big-brain marketing, Mark Zuckerberg has become the new Peoples Choice hero. Theyve also figured out how to develop an enormous fear of missing out among those on the outside. Registering quickly for a Threads account earns you a rating, akin to a race assessment. What makes Twitter differ from Threads? Threads vs Twitter Twitters unique focus on news fosters real-time discussions, allowing users to engage and learn about global events and perspectives. The app Threads faces a data issue, as it currently does not comply with the strict data laws of the European Union. Automatic Status Sharing The software also introduces the notion of automated status sharing, which allows users to automatically share their activities and locations. Threads intelligently recognize and share information about a users current status, such as location, movement, or even the music they are listening to, using powerful AI algorithms. While these capabilities may raise privacy concerns for some users, the app assures that users control information sharing, emphasizing transparency and consent. Conclusion Threads intended to debut in a minimal, stable state for V1, resembling Twitter with deliberate Instagram design aspects. Moreover, it is appropriately called since users have begun to refer to Threads as strings of messages, and its straightforward, with your newsfeed consisting of individuals you follow and those you dont. It nails the basicsvisually appealing, runs smoothly, almost bug-freemaking it a less overwhelming alternative to Twitter.

It senses when we place a puri below,"Automatic Panipuri Water Dispenser At Sunway College Posted on August 26, 2022November 11, 2022 by admin At Sunway College Kathmandu, our IT and research club has developed a creative IoT Based Water dispenser. The Automatic Panipuri Water Dispenser senses when we place a puri below its dispenser pipe, the devices sense the object and fill the puri with a flavored panipuri drink. This gadget has been the pride of Sunway college and also a major source of attraction at different events. Lets know more details on the devices used, the building process, and the working mechanism of this tech from our student Sabin Shrestha. Hello, my name is Sabin Shrestha, and Im now enrolled in the third semester at Sunway College Kathmandu, Nepal. There are many automated devices developed and researched today utilizing IoT. IoT has already made life simpler for us in several ways. It greatly influences how we live our daily lives. However, this initiative is just another one that solicits donations. The project is an automated Panipuri water dispenser, as one would assume from the name. What actually is an Automatic Panipuri Water Dispenser? An automated PaniPuri water dispenser is a gadget that delivers flavored water in specified amounts by automatically sensing the Puri without manual effort. The panipuris flavored water is dispensed using this technique. The system uses electronic components such as an Arduino, a breadboard, a jumper, a relay, and an adjustable IR sensor. The system works on the straightforward premise of detecting an item beneath the sensor and signaling the relay to activate the switch. Devices used Keywords: Arduino, IoT, Relay, Adjustable IR Sensor Benefits of automatic water dispenser Not just for panipuri, this device is usable in many fields. Below are a few benefits of having an automatic water dispenser: Portable Less amount of human effort Fetch the flavored water automatically Less use of the hand. Conventional Increase sales Working Process of the Automatic Panipuri Water Dispenser The device follows 5 different steps to dispense flavored water. Lets break it down and understand. Turn on the device Sense Objects Arduino receives data from the sensor Transmits signals to the relay to turn on the dispenser Fetch flavored water. Methodology of developing an automatic water dispenser The methodology consists of the following steps for making this project real: Research and survey: Research is crucial to any project. Before starting this project, first and foremost we researched past works, designs, and projects. Other, comparable devices, such as automatic sanitizers, have been the subject of research. System Design: In system design, we design the device considering its architecture, shape, and size. Also, We also list out the components for the system and plan the system operation and hardware requirements for the project. Additionally, we designed a 3D print. Software Implementation In the software implementation process, we create Arduino code in the Arduino IDE according to the design and upload the code to Arduino for prototyping and testing. Prototyping  Testing In, Prototyping and testing phase, we test the working of the device with a small developed prototype. Device and component integration: After the prototype, we integrate all devices and components per design and code. The materials such as Arduino, an Adjustable IR Sensor, jumper wires, wires, a USB charger, pipe, wiring strips, 12 v chargers, stalls, etc. Data collection  Analysis In this stage, we gather data and analyze it as necessary. From our analysis, we found, that the object should be 56 cm away to sense by the system. And, It takes 3 seconds to get the flavor-infused water from the bucket once the thing is discovered. Result In the result phase, we gather the outcome. As a consequence, we validate if the system operates as intended. Although the dispenser has to be cleaned every day while it is in use. But the good thing is, This project is working and put into action effectively. Conclusion The Automated Panipuri water dispenser is a gadget that senses the Puri and automatically fetches the flavor-infused water. This method can be handy in restaurants, cafes, hotels, etc. Moreover, the gadget has several benefits as we discussed, and is frequently used for automated dispensing in Nepal and other nations too.

Posted on October 13, 2022June 9, 2023 by admin Have you ever wondered how the TikTok algorithm work? Let us review and understand. TikTok is addictive. It is so addictive that 9 out of 10 users on TikTok use it daily for hours. How do we spend hours on TikTok, even if its a short-content platform? Lets understand how the TikTok For You algorithm works. We will also cover how the basic recommendation algorithm works. Working of TikTok For You Page Recommendation Algorithm Before going in depth on how the TikTok algorithm works, let us understand the metadata. Metadata is the data that provides information about the data. This data helps identify and categorize the content for various backend purposes. Metadata of TikTok Videos Hashtags Hashtags are a few phrases attached to the end of the captions so they can help the algorithm understand the content type. The video uploader usually chooses this. Hashtags are better for a new content creator because they help TikTok identify the type of content theyre uploading. Music TikToks are frequently associated with music. TikTok made a significant move by using copyrighted music as a streaming platform, allowing creators to attach sounds without fear of copyright infringement. The music we choose for a TikTok video categorizes it as well, making it one of the more important pieces of metadata. Content-Duration TikTok is slowly increasing its video content duration limit. The platform started with a 15-second video uploaded over 10 minutes today. The length of the video also categorizes it, making it metadata for a TikTok video. Creator The creator uploading the content is by far the most critical metadata to categorize TikTok videos. Similarly, other metadata such as uploaded time, location, date, and video quality are a few other examples of metadata for a TikTok video. Consumer Ratings on TikTok When a video is released, TikTok usually sends it to all of its active users at once, who are usually chosen based on the metadata of the video that they are watching. Implicit Ratings Implicit ratings are ratings that occur as a result of behavior and cannot be faked by the user. For example, ordering a product from an online store. A few implicit ratings for TikTok videos are: View Time: During the initial video shoot, TikTok closely monitors the average watch duration of the video. There is a trend of looping a TikTok video so that the end can be unnoticed; the clever creator does it so that the watch duration exceeds the actual content duration, signaling the TikTok algorithm. Video Skips: A video viewer usually skips a video when they dont like it. This can be an important signal for TikTok to stop recommending the video that has been skipped and instead recommend some other content category. Profile Visit When consumers like the video, they usually visit the creators profile. This can count as an implicit rating as the user is indicating that they like the creator and want to consume similar content. Explicit Ratings Explicit ratings are the ratings that the user explicitly creates, which means theres some effort in creating explicit ratings. For example, liking a TikTok video A few explicit ratings for TikTok videos are: Likes: The user usually double-taps when they like the content, this helps to increase the likes count for a video and helps the algorithm. Comments: A comment on a video can act as a powerful explicit rating if there is more time and effort required to do so. Shares: Shares are also one of the most powerful explicit ratings as it is one of the rarest ratings, and parallelly, it also creates more exposure for the content. How TikTok algorithm work in recommended videos? As we have understood all the following terms, now we can understand how TikTok algorithm work to recommended videos. Step 1: The user uploads the video, and TikTok takes a few minutes to understand the content based on metadata. Step 2: TikTok distributes the video to a few active users in order to collect preliminary consumption data. Step 3: TikTok typically suggests the video to users who are watching other similarly category videos based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video. Step 4: Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. In conclusion, TikTok is a video-editing app that sends videos to a few active users to collect initial consumption results. Based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video, TikTok usually recommends the content to users who are consuming similar videos. Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. A message from the Sunway Social media and its uses have spread like wildfire lately. People are out and about promoting themselves, their products and services, and their way of life, whether for business or personal reasons. This is what is seen as the new normal for many. The study of social media and its utilization is important for making the most of this powerful medium. A bachelors degree in the field of artificial intelligence would be too good to be true. And, indeed, it is true. If you want to see yourself as an expert digital marketer, then enrolling in the classes is an important step. Sunway has been one of the first colleges in Nepal to provide a bachelors degree in the field of artificial intelligence. If contents like how the TikTok algorithm works catch your attention, then I bet terms like data science and artificial intelligence would certainly do too. More on this later. So, keep an eye on the blog.

https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10/,October 2022 - Sunway College Kathmandu,,,"Month: October 2022 How does the For You algorithm work in TikTok? Posted on October 13, 2022June 9, 2023 by admin Have you ever wondered how the TikTok algorithm work? Let us review and understand. TikTok is addictive. It is so addictive that 9 out of 10 users on TikTok use it daily for hours. How do we spend hours on TikTok, even if its a short-content platform? Lets understand how the TikTok For You algorithm works. We will also cover how the basic recommendation algorithm works. Working of TikTok For You Page Recommendation Algorithm Before going in depth on how the TikTok algorithm works, let us understand the metadata. Metadata is the data that provides information about the data. This data helps identify and categorize the content for various backend purposes. Metadata of TikTok Videos Hashtags Hashtags are a few phrases attached to the end of the captions so they can help the algorithm understand the content type. The video uploader usually chooses this. Hashtags are better for a new content creator because they help TikTok identify the type of content theyre uploading. Music TikToks are frequently associated with music. TikTok made a significant move by using copyrighted music as a streaming platform, allowing creators to attach sounds without fear of copyright infringement. The music we choose for a TikTok video categorizes it as well, making it one of the more important pieces of metadata. Content-Duration TikTok is slowly increasing its video content duration limit. The platform started with a 15-second video uploaded over 10 minutes today. The length of the video also categorizes it, making it metadata for a TikTok video. Creator The creator uploading the content is by far the most critical metadata to categorize TikTok videos. Similarly, other metadata such as uploaded time, location, date, and video quality are a few other examples of metadata for a TikTok video. Consumer Ratings on TikTok When a video is released, TikTok usually sends it to all of its active users at once, who are usually chosen based on the metadata of the video that they are watching. Implicit Ratings Implicit ratings are ratings that occur as a result of behavior and cannot be faked by the user. For example, ordering a product from an online store. A few implicit ratings for TikTok videos are: View Time: During the initial video shoot, TikTok closely monitors the average watch duration of the video. There is a trend of looping a TikTok video so that the end can be unnoticed; the clever creator does it so that the watch duration exceeds the actual content duration, signaling the TikTok algorithm. Video Skips: A video viewer usually skips a video when they dont like it. This can be an important signal for TikTok to stop recommending the video that has been skipped and instead recommend some other content category. Profile Visit When consumers like the video, they usually visit the creators profile. This can count as an implicit rating as the user is indicating that they like the creator and want to consume similar content. Explicit Ratings Explicit ratings are the ratings that the user explicitly creates, which means theres some effort in creating explicit ratings. For example, liking a TikTok video A few explicit ratings for TikTok videos are: Likes: The user usually double-taps when they like the content, this helps to increase the likes count for a video and helps the algorithm. Comments: A comment on a video can act as a powerful explicit rating if there is more time and effort required to do so. Shares: Shares are also one of the most powerful explicit ratings as it is one of the rarest ratings, and parallelly, it also creates more exposure for the content. How TikTok algorithm work in recommended videos? As we have understood all the following terms, now we can understand how TikTok algorithm work to recommended videos. Step 1: The user uploads the video, and TikTok takes a few minutes to understand the content based on metadata. Step 2: TikTok distributes the video to a few active users in order to collect preliminary consumption data. Step 3: TikTok typically suggests the video to users who are watching other similarly category videos based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video. Step 4: Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. In conclusion, TikTok is a video-editing app that sends videos to a few active users to collect initial consumption results. Based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video, TikTok usually recommends the content to users who are consuming similar videos. Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. A message from the Sunway Social media and its uses have spread like wildfire lately. People are out and about promoting themselves, their products and services, and their way of life, whether for business or personal reasons. This is what is seen as the new normal for many. The study of social media and its utilization is important for making the most of this powerful medium. A bachelors degree in the field of artificial intelligence would be too good to be true. And, indeed, it is true. If you want to see yourself as an expert digital marketer, then enrolling in the classes is an important step. Sunway has been one of the first colleges in Nepal to provide a bachelors degree in the field of artificial intelligence. If contents like how the TikTok algorithm works catch your attention, then I bet terms like data science and artificial intelligence would certainly do too. More on this later.

Where does it go? What do we use it for? And, What do most popular data science terms resemble? Data science is the answer to all these questions. Data science is the field of science that applies algorithms, methods, and processes to extract information from random and non-random data. Simply put, it is the process of finding patterns among the noise and using it to predict and solve various problems across a wide range of applications. I will come back to 6 data science terms that everybody must know in 2023, very shortly. It harvests the power of statistics, data analysis, and modeling, along with the use of data structures, algorithms, and machine learning to interpret the findings from massive hordes of data. From Spotifys recommendation algorithms to predicting human behavior, data science has a wide variety of applications in todays fast-paced world. At Sunway College, we primarily focus on bringing the change that is required in the current digital space. The current generation is the Internet generation. According to a report by Statista, in 2021 alone, humanity created 74 zettabytes of data. Thats 74000000000 terabytes of data, in ONE year. Thats up from 59 zettabytes in 2020, and just below the projected 94 zettabytes of data in 2022. Most Popular Terms in Data Science To understand data science, here are a few of the basic keywords and terms that you need to know about today. Algorithms: In computer science, we can define an algorithm as a specific set of processes used to solve a problem or perform computation. Algorithms are hardware and software-specific instruction lists that complete the given process in hand. For example, the simplest of algorithms perform tasks like sorting a set of numbers in descending order, while the most complex set of algorithms guide and work on a natural language processing system.In the field of data science, professionals widely employ algorithms. Given the focus on big data, data scientists need precise algorithms to reduce processing times and operational costs significantly. Some of the common algorithms used in the field of data science include Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting algorithms, etc. Data Mining: We can define data mining as the process of converting raw data into useful information. Data mining involves looking into large sets of data in a database, analyzing patterns and behaviors of the data entities, and using the result to create better algorithms, strategies, and plans for the business.Data science, as the name suggests, heavily operates on data. Therefore, it means it requires a large amount of data to work with. It involves various data mining and warehousing techniques on the data with classification, clustering, and predictive analysis of the given data. Large companies use data mining to create better algorithms, understand customer behavior, and create AI and ML-powered hardware and software. Big Data Big Data can be defined as data, that is BIG literally!. It defines large volumes of data that can be structured or unstructured, mined from various sources in a large quantity. Five Vs define big data: Variety, Volume, Velocity, Value, and Veracity. Big Data is sourced from large, complex sources.Big Data poses a unique challenge addressed by data science. It is a massive capital for businesses and companies that can analyze this data to understand customer behavior, insightful analysis of products and services offered, and predict their purchase and usage behavior. Data science uses various algorithms and processes to derive insights from big data. Deep Learning In computer science, we can define deep learning as the process of machine learning that uses structures similar to human brains called neural networks. Deep learning is used to make better algorithms, data sets, and AI hardware and software. Deep learning uses powerful computers and large sets of data with output called supervised learning and without output called unsupervised learning to understand and predict patterns and outcomes.In Data Science, we employ the use of neural networks and methodologies to study big data with massive models on a large level computational scale. Usually, we utilize deep learning to create better algorithms, and insights on specifics such as user experience of a product, facial recognition, behavior pattern processing, etc. Data science combines the power of deep learning, data, and computer science to generate new insights and value for businesses. Web Scraping Web scraping is the web data extraction process used to extract data from websites. Automated technology retrieves bulk unstructured data, typically HTML, from numerous websites in the process known as web scraping. A database methodically stores structured data, facilitating its utilization for analysis, training, and research purposes.Data scientists use various existing frameworks such as Scrapy, a Python-based web crawler. Data scientists prefer Beautiful Soup, a tool akin to extracting and storing large website data in databases. Therefore, we use web scraping for price monitoring across e-commerce platforms and email marketing. Similarly, emotion analysis across social media platforms and news monitoring purposes are also done using web scraping. Moreover, this data can also be fed to machine learning algorithms for training and prediction purposes. Natural Language Processing NLP: One of the most frequent data science terms. Natural Language Processing is a subfield of deep learning that is concerned with Human Linguistics. It is the process of identifying and understanding meaningful phrases from a human language and generating meaningful phrases and sentences that look like a natural form. NLP includes two sub-sections, Natural Language Understanding NLU, and Natural Language Generation NLG. Natural Language Processing involves five phases. Lexical structure analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, discourse integration, and pragmatic analysis. Some of the well-known areas of NLP are Speech recognition Siri, Google Assistant, ChatbotsMaya chat, , and Optical Character recognition Google Lens,.

Data Science and Artificial Intelligence  A career that never ends IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor by Sabin Shrestha Posted on August 5, 2022November 11, 2022 by admin At Sunway College, we have a dedicated research lab Sunway College Research Lab where we focus on experimenting and researching different IoT-based devices. Our mini research is also one of the most loved workplaces for some of our robotic geeks. We provide drones, 3D printers, and other essentials that our students request for their research. One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha and team have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself. Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at Sunway College Kathmandu March 2021 Intake. Lets have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor. Water Heating: Till Now Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more. There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences. In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? The rise of IoT Internet of Things is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term Internet of Things IoT describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. Theres usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 Temperature-Humidity Sensor Bread Board DS18B20 Water Temperature Sensor Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil  Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, lets understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the projects outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result  Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ides serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometers serial monitor is compared. Acknowledgment I would like to express my warm thank you to Sunway College Kathmandu as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project. Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of Sunway College Kathmandu. I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more. The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway Colleges research lab and beyond that.

In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? The rise of IoT Internet of Things is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term Internet of Things IoT describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. Theres usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 Temperature-Humidity Sensor Bread Board DS18B20 Water Temperature Sensor Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil  Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, lets understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the projects outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result  Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ides serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometers serial monitor is compared. Acknowledgment I would like to express my warm thank you to Sunway College Kathmandu as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project. Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of Sunway College Kathmandu. I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more. The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway Colleges research lab and beyond that.

Some major data science terms are algorithms, natural language processing.","6 Data Science Terms Everybody Must Know in 2023 Posted on August 11, 2022January 26, 2024 by admin What happens to all this data? Where does it go? What do we use it for? And, What do most popular data science terms resemble? Data science is the answer to all these questions. Data science is the field of science that applies algorithms, methods, and processes to extract information from random and non-random data. Simply put, it is the process of finding patterns among the noise and using it to predict and solve various problems across a wide range of applications. I will come back to 6 data science terms that everybody must know in 2023, very shortly. It harvests the power of statistics, data analysis, and modeling, along with the use of data structures, algorithms, and machine learning to interpret the findings from massive hordes of data. From Spotifys recommendation algorithms to predicting human behavior, data science has a wide variety of applications in todays fast-paced world. At Sunway College, we primarily focus on bringing the change that is required in the current digital space. The current generation is the Internet generation. According to a report by Statista, in 2021 alone, humanity created 74 zettabytes of data. Thats 74000000000 terabytes of data, in ONE year. Thats up from 59 zettabytes in 2020, and just below the projected 94 zettabytes of data in 2022. Most Popular Terms in Data Science To understand data science, here are a few of the basic keywords and terms that you need to know about today. Algorithms: In computer science, we can define an algorithm as a specific set of processes used to solve a problem or perform computation. Algorithms are hardware and software-specific instruction lists that complete the given process in hand. For example, the simplest of algorithms perform tasks like sorting a set of numbers in descending order, while the most complex set of algorithms guide and work on a natural language processing system.In the field of data science, professionals widely employ algorithms. Given the focus on big data, data scientists need precise algorithms to reduce processing times and operational costs significantly. Some of the common algorithms used in the field of data science include Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting algorithms, etc. Data Mining: We can define data mining as the process of converting raw data into useful information. Data mining involves looking into large sets of data in a database, analyzing patterns and behaviors of the data entities, and using the result to create better algorithms, strategies, and plans for the business.Data science, as the name suggests, heavily operates on data. Therefore, it means it requires a large amount of data to work with. It involves various data mining and warehousing techniques on the data with classification, clustering, and predictive analysis of the given data. Large companies use data mining to create better algorithms, understand customer behavior, and create AI and ML-powered hardware and software. Big Data Big Data can be defined as data, that is BIG literally!. It defines large volumes of data that can be structured or unstructured, mined from various sources in a large quantity. Five Vs define big data: Variety, Volume, Velocity, Value, and Veracity. Big Data is sourced from large, complex sources.Big Data poses a unique challenge addressed by data science. It is a massive capital for businesses and companies that can analyze this data to understand customer behavior, insightful analysis of products and services offered, and predict their purchase and usage behavior. Data science uses various algorithms and processes to derive insights from big data. Deep Learning In computer science, we can define deep learning as the process of machine learning that uses structures similar to human brains called neural networks. Deep learning is used to make better algorithms, data sets, and AI hardware and software. Deep learning uses powerful computers and large sets of data with output called supervised learning and without output called unsupervised learning to understand and predict patterns and outcomes.In Data Science, we employ the use of neural networks and methodologies to study big data with massive models on a large level computational scale. Usually, we utilize deep learning to create better algorithms, and insights on specifics such as user experience of a product, facial recognition, behavior pattern processing, etc. Data science combines the power of deep learning, data, and computer science to generate new insights and value for businesses. Web Scraping Web scraping is the web data extraction process used to extract data from websites. Automated technology retrieves bulk unstructured data, typically HTML, from numerous websites in the process known as web scraping. A database methodically stores structured data, facilitating its utilization for analysis, training, and research purposes.Data scientists use various existing frameworks such as Scrapy, a Python-based web crawler. Data scientists prefer Beautiful Soup, a tool akin to extracting and storing large website data in databases. Therefore, we use web scraping for price monitoring across e-commerce platforms and email marketing. Similarly, emotion analysis across social media platforms and news monitoring purposes are also done using web scraping. Moreover, this data can also be fed to machine learning algorithms for training and prediction purposes. Natural Language Processing NLP: One of the most frequent data science terms. Natural Language Processing is a subfield of deep learning that is concerned with Human Linguistics. It is the process of identifying and understanding meaningful phrases from a human language and generating meaningful phrases and sentences that look like a natural form. NLP includes two sub-sections, Natural Language Understanding NLU, and Natural Language Generation NLG. Natural Language Processing involves five phases. Lexical structure analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, discourse integration, and pragmatic analysis. Some of the well-known areas of NLP are Speech recognition Siri, Google Assistant, ChatbotsMaya chat, , and Optical Character recognition Google Lens,. Conclusion We can understand the importance of data science in todays technology-infused world. Understanding data science terms broadens domains, aiding students and enthusiasts in getting serious about this field. We have introduced two new courses in a digital space. BSc Hons Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, our Bachelors course in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence solely focuses on preparing students with the required skills academically and practically to pursue a career in artificial intelligence and data science. We do have a team of field experts and academically profound professors with their guidance. You can achieve the best in the data science and artificial intelligence field.

Where does it go? What do we use it for? And, What do most popular data science terms resemble? Data science is the answer to all these questions. Data science is the field of science that applies algorithms, methods, and processes to extract information from random and non-random data. Simply put, it is the process of finding patterns among the noise and using it to predict and solve various problems across a wide range of applications. I will come back to 6 data science terms that everybody must know in 2023, very shortly. It harvests the power of statistics, data analysis, and modeling, along with the use of data structures, algorithms, and machine learning to interpret the findings from massive hordes of data. From Spotifys recommendation algorithms to predicting human behavior, data science has a wide variety of applications in todays fast-paced world. At Sunway College, we primarily focus on bringing the change that is required in the current digital space. The current generation is the Internet generation. According to a report by Statista, in 2021 alone, humanity created 74 zettabytes of data. Thats 74000000000 terabytes of data, in ONE year. Thats up from 59 zettabytes in 2020, and just below the projected 94 zettabytes of data in 2022. Most Popular Terms in Data Science To understand data science, here are a few of the basic keywords and terms that you need to know about today. Algorithms: In computer science, we can define an algorithm as a specific set of processes used to solve a problem or perform computation. Algorithms are hardware and software-specific instruction lists that complete the given process in hand. For example, the simplest of algorithms perform tasks like sorting a set of numbers in descending order, while the most complex set of algorithms guide and work on a natural language processing system.In the field of data science, professionals widely employ algorithms. Given the focus on big data, data scientists need precise algorithms to reduce processing times and operational costs significantly. Some of the common algorithms used in the field of data science include Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting algorithms, etc. Data Mining: We can define data mining as the process of converting raw data into useful information. Data mining involves looking into large sets of data in a database, analyzing patterns and behaviors of the data entities, and using the result to create better algorithms, strategies, and plans for the business.Data science, as the name suggests, heavily operates on data. Therefore, it means it requires a large amount of data to work with. It involves various data mining and warehousing techniques on the data with classification, clustering, and predictive analysis of the given data. Large companies use data mining to create better algorithms, understand customer behavior, and create AI and ML-powered hardware and software. Big Data Big Data can be defined as data, that is BIG literally!. It defines large volumes of data that can be structured or unstructured, mined from various sources in a large quantity. Five Vs define big data: Variety, Volume, Velocity, Value, and Veracity. Big Data is sourced from large, complex sources.Big Data poses a unique challenge addressed by data science. It is a massive capital for businesses and companies that can analyze this data to understand customer behavior, insightful analysis of products and services offered, and predict their purchase and usage behavior. Data science uses various algorithms and processes to derive insights from big data. Deep Learning In computer science, we can define deep learning as the process of machine learning that uses structures similar to human brains called neural networks. Deep learning is used to make better algorithms, data sets, and AI hardware and software. Deep learning uses powerful computers and large sets of data with output called supervised learning and without output called unsupervised learning to understand and predict patterns and outcomes.In Data Science, we employ the use of neural networks and methodologies to study big data with massive models on a large level computational scale. Usually, we utilize deep learning to create better algorithms, and insights on specifics such as user experience of a product, facial recognition, behavior pattern processing, etc. Data science combines the power of deep learning, data, and computer science to generate new insights and value for businesses. Web Scraping Web scraping is the web data extraction process used to extract data from websites. Automated technology retrieves bulk unstructured data, typically HTML, from numerous websites in the process known as web scraping. A database methodically stores structured data, facilitating its utilization for analysis, training, and research purposes.Data scientists use various existing frameworks such as Scrapy, a Python-based web crawler. Data scientists prefer Beautiful Soup, a tool akin to extracting and storing large website data in databases. Therefore, we use web scraping for price monitoring across e-commerce platforms and email marketing. Similarly, emotion analysis across social media platforms and news monitoring purposes are also done using web scraping. Moreover, this data can also be fed to machine learning algorithms for training and prediction purposes. Natural Language Processing NLP: One of the most frequent data science terms. Natural Language Processing is a subfield of deep learning that is concerned with Human Linguistics. It is the process of identifying and understanding meaningful phrases from a human language and generating meaningful phrases and sentences that look like a natural form. NLP includes two sub-sections, Natural Language Understanding NLU, and Natural Language Generation NLG. Natural Language Processing involves five phases. Lexical structure analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, discourse integration, and pragmatic analysis. Some of the well-known areas of NLP are Speech recognition Siri, Google Assistant, ChatbotsMaya chat, , and Optical Character recognition Google Lens,. Conclusion We can understand the importance of data science in todays technology-infused world. Understanding data science terms broadens domains, aiding students and enthusiasts in getting serious about this field. We have introduced two new courses in a digital space. BSc Hons Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, our Bachelors course in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence solely focuses on preparing students with the required skills academically and practically to pursue a career in artificial intelligence and data science. We do have a team of field experts and academically profound professors with their guidance. You can achieve the best in the data science and artificial intelligence field.

Turn on the device Sense Objects Arduino receives data from the sensor Transmits signals to the relay to turn on the dispenser Fetch flavored water. Methodology of developing an automatic water dispenser The methodology consists of the following steps for making this project real: Research and survey: Research is crucial to any project. Before starting this project, first and foremost we researched past works, designs, and projects. Other, comparable devices, such as automatic sanitizers, have been the subject of research. System Design: In system design, we design the device considering its architecture, shape, and size. Also, We also list out the components for the system and plan the system operation and hardware requirements for the project. Additionally, we designed a 3D print. Software Implementation In the software implementation process, we create Arduino code in the Arduino IDE according to the design and upload the code to Arduino for prototyping and testing. Prototyping  Testing In, Prototyping and testing phase, we test the working of the device with a small developed prototype. Device and component integration: After the prototype, we integrate all devices and components per design and code. The materials such as Arduino, an Adjustable IR Sensor, jumper wires, wires, a USB charger, pipe, wiring strips, 12 v chargers, stalls, etc. Data collection  Analysis In this stage, we gather data and analyze it as necessary. From our analysis, we found, that the object should be 56 cm away to sense by the system. And, It takes 3 seconds to get the flavor-infused water from the bucket once the thing is discovered. Result In the result phase, we gather the outcome. As a consequence, we validate if the system operates as intended. Although the dispenser has to be cleaned every day while it is in use. But the good thing is, This project is working and put into action effectively. Conclusion The Automated Panipuri water dispenser is a gadget that senses the Puri and automatically fetches the flavor-infused water. This method can be handy in restaurants, cafes, hotels, etc. Moreover, the gadget has several benefits as we discussed, and is frequently used for automated dispensing in Nepal and other nations too.

Our mini research is also one of the most loved workplaces for some of our robotic geeks. We provide drones, 3D printers, and other essentials that our students request for their research. One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha and team have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself. Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at Sunway College Kathmandu March 2021 Intake. Lets have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor. Water Heating: Till Now Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more. There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences. In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? The rise of IoT Internet of Things is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term Internet of Things IoT describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. Theres usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 Temperature-Humidity Sensor Bread Board DS18B20 Water Temperature Sensor Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil  Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, lets understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the projects outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result  Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ides serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometers serial monitor is compared. Acknowledgment I would like to express my warm thank you to Sunway College Kathmandu as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project. Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of Sunway College Kathmandu. I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more. The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway Colleges research lab and beyond that. Posted in student blog Post navigation Next: What to study after 2?

Lets know more details on the devices used, the building process, and the working mechanism of this tech from our student Sabin Shrestha. Hello, my name is Sabin Shrestha, and Im now enrolled in the third semester at Sunway College Kathmandu, Nepal. There are many automated devices developed and researched today utilizing IoT. IoT has already made life simpler for us in several ways. It greatly influences how we live our daily lives. However, this initiative is just another one that solicits donations. The project is an automated Panipuri water dispenser, as one would assume from the name. What actually is an Automatic Panipuri Water Dispenser? An automated PaniPuri water dispenser is a gadget that delivers flavored water in specified amounts by automatically sensing the Puri without manual effort. The panipuris flavored water is dispensed using this technique. The system uses electronic components such as an Arduino, a breadboard, a jumper, a relay, and an adjustable IR sensor. The system works on the straightforward premise of detecting an item beneath the sensor and signaling the relay to activate the switch. Devices used Keywords: Arduino, IoT, Relay, Adjustable IR Sensor Benefits of automatic water dispenser Not just for panipuri, this device is usable in many fields. Below are a few benefits of having an automatic water dispenser: Portable Less amount of human effort Fetch the flavored water automatically Less use of the hand. Conventional Increase sales Working Process of the Automatic Panipuri Water Dispenser The device follows 5 different steps to dispense flavored water. Lets break it down and understand. Turn on the device Sense Objects Arduino receives data from the sensor Transmits signals to the relay to turn on the dispenser Fetch flavored water. Methodology of developing an automatic water dispenser The methodology consists of the following steps for making this project real: Research and survey: Research is crucial to any project. Before starting this project, first and foremost we researched past works, designs, and projects. Other, comparable devices, such as automatic sanitizers, have been the subject of research. System Design: In system design, we design the device considering its architecture, shape, and size. Also, We also list out the components for the system and plan the system operation and hardware requirements for the project. Additionally, we designed a 3D print. Software Implementation In the software implementation process, we create Arduino code in the Arduino IDE according to the design and upload the code to Arduino for prototyping and testing. Prototyping  Testing In, Prototyping and testing phase, we test the working of the device with a small developed prototype. Device and component integration: After the prototype, we integrate all devices and components per design and code. The materials such as Arduino, an Adjustable IR Sensor, jumper wires, wires, a USB charger, pipe, wiring strips, 12 v chargers, stalls, etc. Data collection  Analysis In this stage, we gather data and analyze it as necessary. From our analysis, we found, that the object should be 56 cm away to sense by the system. And, It takes 3 seconds to get the flavor-infused water from the bucket once the thing is discovered. Result In the result phase, we gather the outcome. As a consequence, we validate if the system operates as intended. Although the dispenser has to be cleaned every day while it is in use. But the good thing is, This project is working and put into action effectively. Conclusion The Automated Panipuri water dispenser is a gadget that senses the Puri and automatically fetches the flavor-infused water. This method can be handy in restaurants, cafes, hotels, etc. Moreover, the gadget has several benefits as we discussed, and is frequently used for automated dispensing in Nepal and other nations too.

Posted in data science, student blogLeave a Comment on What to study after 2? Data Science and Artificial Intelligence  A career that never ends IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor by Sabin Shrestha Posted on August 5, 2022November 11, 2022 by admin At Sunway College, we have a dedicated research lab Sunway College Research Lab where we focus on experimenting and researching different IoT-based devices. Our mini research is also one of the most loved workplaces for some of our robotic geeks. We provide drones, 3D printers, and other essentials that our students request for their research. One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha and team have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself. Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at Sunway College Kathmandu March 2021 Intake. Lets have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor. Water Heating: Till Now Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more. There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences. In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? The rise of IoT Internet of Things is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term Internet of Things IoT describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. Theres usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 Temperature-Humidity Sensor Bread Board DS18B20 Water Temperature Sensor Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil  Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, lets understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the projects outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result  Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ides serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometers serial monitor is compared.

Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of Sunway College Kathmandu. I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more.

https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10/#masthead,October 2022 - Sunway College Kathmandu,,,"Month: October 2022 How does the For You algorithm work in TikTok? Posted on October 13, 2022June 9, 2023 by admin Have you ever wondered how the TikTok algorithm work? Let us review and understand. TikTok is addictive. It is so addictive that 9 out of 10 users on TikTok use it daily for hours. How do we spend hours on TikTok, even if its a short-content platform? Lets understand how the TikTok For You algorithm works. We will also cover how the basic recommendation algorithm works. Working of TikTok For You Page Recommendation Algorithm Before going in depth on how the TikTok algorithm works, let us understand the metadata. Metadata is the data that provides information about the data. This data helps identify and categorize the content for various backend purposes. Metadata of TikTok Videos Hashtags Hashtags are a few phrases attached to the end of the captions so they can help the algorithm understand the content type. The video uploader usually chooses this. Hashtags are better for a new content creator because they help TikTok identify the type of content theyre uploading. Music TikToks are frequently associated with music. TikTok made a significant move by using copyrighted music as a streaming platform, allowing creators to attach sounds without fear of copyright infringement. The music we choose for a TikTok video categorizes it as well, making it one of the more important pieces of metadata. Content-Duration TikTok is slowly increasing its video content duration limit. The platform started with a 15-second video uploaded over 10 minutes today. The length of the video also categorizes it, making it metadata for a TikTok video. Creator The creator uploading the content is by far the most critical metadata to categorize TikTok videos. Similarly, other metadata such as uploaded time, location, date, and video quality are a few other examples of metadata for a TikTok video. Consumer Ratings on TikTok When a video is released, TikTok usually sends it to all of its active users at once, who are usually chosen based on the metadata of the video that they are watching. Implicit Ratings Implicit ratings are ratings that occur as a result of behavior and cannot be faked by the user. For example, ordering a product from an online store. A few implicit ratings for TikTok videos are: View Time: During the initial video shoot, TikTok closely monitors the average watch duration of the video. There is a trend of looping a TikTok video so that the end can be unnoticed; the clever creator does it so that the watch duration exceeds the actual content duration, signaling the TikTok algorithm. Video Skips: A video viewer usually skips a video when they dont like it. This can be an important signal for TikTok to stop recommending the video that has been skipped and instead recommend some other content category. Profile Visit When consumers like the video, they usually visit the creators profile. This can count as an implicit rating as the user is indicating that they like the creator and want to consume similar content. Explicit Ratings Explicit ratings are the ratings that the user explicitly creates, which means theres some effort in creating explicit ratings. For example, liking a TikTok video A few explicit ratings for TikTok videos are: Likes: The user usually double-taps when they like the content, this helps to increase the likes count for a video and helps the algorithm. Comments: A comment on a video can act as a powerful explicit rating if there is more time and effort required to do so. Shares: Shares are also one of the most powerful explicit ratings as it is one of the rarest ratings, and parallelly, it also creates more exposure for the content. How TikTok algorithm work in recommended videos? As we have understood all the following terms, now we can understand how TikTok algorithm work to recommended videos. Step 1: The user uploads the video, and TikTok takes a few minutes to understand the content based on metadata. Step 2: TikTok distributes the video to a few active users in order to collect preliminary consumption data. Step 3: TikTok typically suggests the video to users who are watching other similarly category videos based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video. Step 4: Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. In conclusion, TikTok is a video-editing app that sends videos to a few active users to collect initial consumption results. Based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video, TikTok usually recommends the content to users who are consuming similar videos. Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. A message from the Sunway Social media and its uses have spread like wildfire lately. People are out and about promoting themselves, their products and services, and their way of life, whether for business or personal reasons. This is what is seen as the new normal for many. The study of social media and its utilization is important for making the most of this powerful medium. A bachelors degree in the field of artificial intelligence would be too good to be true. And, indeed, it is true. If you want to see yourself as an expert digital marketer, then enrolling in the classes is an important step. Sunway has been one of the first colleges in Nepal to provide a bachelors degree in the field of artificial intelligence. If contents like how the TikTok algorithm works catch your attention, then I bet terms like data science and artificial intelligence would certainly do too. More on this later. So, keep an eye on the blog. Posted in UncategorizedLeave a Comment on How does the For You algorithm work in TikTok?

https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work/#masthead,How does the TikTok algorithm work?,2023-06-09T08:34:22+00:00,"How the TikTok algorithm work is by analyzing your content duration, video skips, and lot of other key attributes.","How does the For You algorithm work in TikTok? Posted on October 13, 2022June 9, 2023 by admin Have you ever wondered how the TikTok algorithm work? Let us review and understand. TikTok is addictive. It is so addictive that 9 out of 10 users on TikTok use it daily for hours. How do we spend hours on TikTok, even if its a short-content platform? Lets understand how the TikTok For You algorithm works. We will also cover how the basic recommendation algorithm works. Working of TikTok For You Page Recommendation Algorithm Before going in depth on how the TikTok algorithm works, let us understand the metadata. Metadata is the data that provides information about the data. This data helps identify and categorize the content for various backend purposes. Metadata of TikTok Videos Hashtags Hashtags are a few phrases attached to the end of the captions so they can help the algorithm understand the content type. The video uploader usually chooses this. Hashtags are better for a new content creator because they help TikTok identify the type of content theyre uploading. Music TikToks are frequently associated with music. TikTok made a significant move by using copyrighted music as a streaming platform, allowing creators to attach sounds without fear of copyright infringement. The music we choose for a TikTok video categorizes it as well, making it one of the more important pieces of metadata. Content-Duration TikTok is slowly increasing its video content duration limit. The platform started with a 15-second video uploaded over 10 minutes today. The length of the video also categorizes it, making it metadata for a TikTok video. Creator The creator uploading the content is by far the most critical metadata to categorize TikTok videos. Similarly, other metadata such as uploaded time, location, date, and video quality are a few other examples of metadata for a TikTok video. Consumer Ratings on TikTok When a video is released, TikTok usually sends it to all of its active users at once, who are usually chosen based on the metadata of the video that they are watching. Implicit Ratings Implicit ratings are ratings that occur as a result of behavior and cannot be faked by the user. For example, ordering a product from an online store. A few implicit ratings for TikTok videos are: View Time: During the initial video shoot, TikTok closely monitors the average watch duration of the video. There is a trend of looping a TikTok video so that the end can be unnoticed; the clever creator does it so that the watch duration exceeds the actual content duration, signaling the TikTok algorithm. Video Skips: A video viewer usually skips a video when they dont like it. This can be an important signal for TikTok to stop recommending the video that has been skipped and instead recommend some other content category. Profile Visit When consumers like the video, they usually visit the creators profile. This can count as an implicit rating as the user is indicating that they like the creator and want to consume similar content. Explicit Ratings Explicit ratings are the ratings that the user explicitly creates, which means theres some effort in creating explicit ratings. For example, liking a TikTok video A few explicit ratings for TikTok videos are: Likes: The user usually double-taps when they like the content, this helps to increase the likes count for a video and helps the algorithm. Comments: A comment on a video can act as a powerful explicit rating if there is more time and effort required to do so. Shares: Shares are also one of the most powerful explicit ratings as it is one of the rarest ratings, and parallelly, it also creates more exposure for the content. How TikTok algorithm work in recommended videos? As we have understood all the following terms, now we can understand how TikTok algorithm work to recommended videos. Step 1: The user uploads the video, and TikTok takes a few minutes to understand the content based on metadata. Step 2: TikTok distributes the video to a few active users in order to collect preliminary consumption data. Step 3: TikTok typically suggests the video to users who are watching other similarly category videos based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video. Step 4: Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. In conclusion, TikTok is a video-editing app that sends videos to a few active users to collect initial consumption results. Based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video, TikTok usually recommends the content to users who are consuming similar videos. Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. A message from the Sunway Social media and its uses have spread like wildfire lately.

Thats up from 59 zettabytes in 2020, and just below the projected 94 zettabytes of data in 2022. Most Popular Terms in Data Science To understand data science, here are a few of the basic keywords and terms that you need to know about today. Algorithms: In computer science, we can define an algorithm as a specific set of processes used to solve a problem or perform computation. Algorithms are hardware and software-specific instruction lists that complete the given process in hand. For example, the simplest of algorithms perform tasks like sorting a set of numbers in descending order, while the most complex set of algorithms guide and work on a natural language processing system.In the field of data science, professionals widely employ algorithms. Given the focus on big data, data scientists need precise algorithms to reduce processing times and operational costs significantly. Some of the common algorithms used in the field of data science include Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting algorithms, etc. Data Mining: We can define data mining as the process of converting raw data into useful information. Data mining involves looking into large sets of data in a database, analyzing patterns and behaviors of the data entities, and using the result to create better algorithms, strategies, and plans for the business.Data science, as the name suggests, heavily operates on data. Therefore, it means it requires a large amount of data to work with. It involves various data mining and warehousing techniques on the data with classification, clustering, and predictive analysis of the given data. Large companies use data mining to create better algorithms, understand customer behavior, and create AI and ML-powered hardware and software. Big Data Big Data can be defined as data, that is BIG literally!. It defines large volumes of data that can be structured or unstructured, mined from various sources in a large quantity. Five Vs define big data: Variety, Volume, Velocity, Value, and Veracity. Big Data is sourced from large, complex sources.Big Data poses a unique challenge addressed by data science. It is a massive capital for businesses and companies that can analyze this data to understand customer behavior, insightful analysis of products and services offered, and predict their purchase and usage behavior. Data science uses various algorithms and processes to derive insights from big data. Deep Learning In computer science, we can define deep learning as the process of machine learning that uses structures similar to human brains called neural networks. Deep learning is used to make better algorithms, data sets, and AI hardware and software. Deep learning uses powerful computers and large sets of data with output called supervised learning and without output called unsupervised learning to understand and predict patterns and outcomes.In Data Science, we employ the use of neural networks and methodologies to study big data with massive models on a large level computational scale. Usually, we utilize deep learning to create better algorithms, and insights on specifics such as user experience of a product, facial recognition, behavior pattern processing, etc. Data science combines the power of deep learning, data, and computer science to generate new insights and value for businesses. Web Scraping Web scraping is the web data extraction process used to extract data from websites. Automated technology retrieves bulk unstructured data, typically HTML, from numerous websites in the process known as web scraping. A database methodically stores structured data, facilitating its utilization for analysis, training, and research purposes.Data scientists use various existing frameworks such as Scrapy, a Python-based web crawler. Data scientists prefer Beautiful Soup, a tool akin to extracting and storing large website data in databases. Therefore, we use web scraping for price monitoring across e-commerce platforms and email marketing. Similarly, emotion analysis across social media platforms and news monitoring purposes are also done using web scraping. Moreover, this data can also be fed to machine learning algorithms for training and prediction purposes. Natural Language Processing NLP: One of the most frequent data science terms. Natural Language Processing is a subfield of deep learning that is concerned with Human Linguistics. It is the process of identifying and understanding meaningful phrases from a human language and generating meaningful phrases and sentences that look like a natural form. NLP includes two sub-sections, Natural Language Understanding NLU, and Natural Language Generation NLG. Natural Language Processing involves five phases. Lexical structure analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, discourse integration, and pragmatic analysis. Some of the well-known areas of NLP are Speech recognition Siri, Google Assistant, ChatbotsMaya chat, , and Optical Character recognition Google Lens,.

Threads allow you to see a feed of everything thats going on with your friends or persons youre interested in. You may also upload messages, text, images, and videos. You might also respond to or like messages. Threads Vs Twitter Twitter has increased the number of advertisements that appear after one out of every five postings. An individual has a large number of bot accounts and improper accounts that need to be detected. Twitter charges for verification, risking fake paid Elon Musk accounts. Limited daily tweets can be viewed unless users pay to increase the limit. Threads aims to counter negative sentiment toward Twitter meta, explicitly stating no monetization until the app hits a billion users. How do Threads work? Theyve adjusted it so that everyone must have an Instagram account before theyre able to sign up, which has significantly reduced the degree of Bot activity. Because its linked to your Instagram account, you wont have to pay for verification, and it will automatically transfer from your Instagram to your Threads account. Threads unexpected buzz makes it seem like everyone is already there, a challenge for new platforms. When one of your Instagram followers signs up for Threads, they automatically follow you, giving the user a huge boost in enthusiasm. As a result, threads seem like this New Haven is like a fresh start on Twitter. Because of his superb timing and some big-brain marketing, Mark Zuckerberg has become the new Peoples Choice hero.

Natural Language Model Natural Language Model is the most well-known model of Generative AI, with ChatGPT making headlines. The majority of the excitement around text-based Generative AI is centered on a model known as GPT-3. Its a language model created by OpenAI, a research group dedicated to the development and promotion of friendly AI. For example, while computers cannot understand language in the same way that humans can, natural language technologies are becoming more effective at identifying the context and meaning of phrases and words and converting them into suitable responsesand actions. 2. Generative Adversarial Networks GANs Generative Adversarial Networks GANs are a well-known form of Generative AI. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator that work together to enhance the generators ability to generate realistic data. Over time, the generator improves its capacity to synthesize lifelike data, resulting in the creation of new items, assets, faces, and even people. GANs can be utilized for various applications, including generating natural features such as lightning, leaves, roots, eyes, and flowers, as well as seamlessly integrating humans with nature. Furthermore, in the context of financial fraud detection, GAN models can generate synthetic fraudulent transactions to train fraud detection algorithms. 3. VAE and Anomaly Detection Variational Autoencoders VAE are a major model used for anomaly identification. It entails training the model on a collection of normal data and then utilizing it to detect occurrences that deviate from the norm. VAE has applications in a variety of fields, including financial fraud detection, discovering defects in manufacturing processes, and detecting network breaches. For example, Google has used VAE to identify network attacks. Future Prediction Generative AI will continue to play a critical role in computer graphics, animation, and 3D modeling in the gaming, film, and marketing industries. It will also be employed in the next decade or so to improve virtual assistants and chatbots natural language understanding, allowing them to conduct complicated discussions. In the future, generative AI will help to create realistic simulations in sectors like architecture and engineering, create new materials and products in manufacturing and textile design, and aid in natural language production for news articles, novels, and movie screenplays. Conclusion In terms of utility and predictability, generative AI is similar to a camera, acting as a powerful instrument in the hands of people. Just like a camera performs reliably, generative AI follows the same pattern each time it is used. It enables people to use their skills to generate content, develop new solutions, and explore creative possibilities. Users may leverage the potential of generative AI to improve productivity, accelerate improvements, and stimulate discoveries by understanding and utilizing its consistent nature.

Posted on July 26, 2023January 26, 2024 by admin Threads is a social networking software developed by Meta, which created Instagram and Facebook. Threads allow you to see a feed of everything thats going on with your friends or persons youre interested in. You may also upload messages, text, images, and videos. You might also respond to or like messages. Threads Vs Twitter Twitter has increased the number of advertisements that appear after one out of every five postings. An individual has a large number of bot accounts and improper accounts that need to be detected. Twitter charges for verification, risking fake paid Elon Musk accounts. Limited daily tweets can be viewed unless users pay to increase the limit. Threads aims to counter negative sentiment toward Twitter meta, explicitly stating no monetization until the app hits a billion users. How do Threads work? Theyve adjusted it so that everyone must have an Instagram account before theyre able to sign up, which has significantly reduced the degree of Bot activity. Because its linked to your Instagram account, you wont have to pay for verification, and it will automatically transfer from your Instagram to your Threads account. Threads unexpected buzz makes it seem like everyone is already there, a challenge for new platforms. When one of your Instagram followers signs up for Threads, they automatically follow you, giving the user a huge boost in enthusiasm. As a result, threads seem like this New Haven is like a fresh start on Twitter. Because of his superb timing and some big-brain marketing, Mark Zuckerberg has become the new Peoples Choice hero. Theyve also figured out how to develop an enormous fear of missing out among those on the outside. Registering quickly for a Threads account earns you a rating, akin to a race assessment. What makes Twitter differ from Threads? Threads vs Twitter Twitters unique focus on news fosters real-time discussions, allowing users to engage and learn about global events and perspectives. The app Threads faces a data issue, as it currently does not comply with the strict data laws of the European Union. Automatic Status Sharing The software also introduces the notion of automated status sharing, which allows users to automatically share their activities and locations. Threads intelligently recognize and share information about a users current status, such as location, movement, or even the music they are listening to, using powerful AI algorithms. While these capabilities may raise privacy concerns for some users, the app assures that users control information sharing, emphasizing transparency and consent. Conclusion Threads intended to debut in a minimal, stable state for V1, resembling Twitter with deliberate Instagram design aspects. Moreover, it is appropriately called since users have begun to refer to Threads as strings of messages, and its straightforward, with your newsfeed consisting of individuals you follow and those you dont. It nails the basicsvisually appealing, runs smoothly, almost bug-freemaking it a less overwhelming alternative to Twitter.

https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter/#masthead,Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter?,2023-09-27T11:44:17+00:00,What are your thoughts on these trends in Netflix movie lengths? Do you think these changes are primarily driven by viewer preferences?,"Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter? Posted on September 27, 2023September 27, 2023 by Simoli Desai I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and Im excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, its not that straightforward.  Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, its essential to note that not all genres are following this trend. Heres what I discovered:  Decline in Length: Genres like Childrens and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content.  Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friends data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainmentmedia company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If were going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first well need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Lets start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. Well also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Lets perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friends assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friends aggregations, were limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path datasetsnetflix_data.csv. Lets create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friends data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, its clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While were at it, we dont need information from all of the columns, so lets create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration. Lets put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now were getting somewhere. Weve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Lets try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so lets try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Lets filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as Children, Stand-Up, and Documentaries. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, well also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use. The latter isnt taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as childrens movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we cant know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, youve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas. We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri Posted in student blog Post navigation Previous: Partner Institutions with DigiSchool  UK CollegesNext: Study in Nepal with ECAN SoftEd IT Scholarship Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.

https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09/#masthead,September 2023 - Sunway College Kathmandu,,,"Month: September 2023 Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter? Posted on September 27, 2023September 27, 2023 by Simoli Desai I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and Im excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, its not that straightforward.  Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, its essential to note that not all genres are following this trend. Heres what I discovered:  Decline in Length: Genres like Childrens and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content.  Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friends data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainmentmedia company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If were going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first well need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Lets start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. Well also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Lets perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friends assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friends aggregations, were limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path datasetsnetflix_data.csv. Lets create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friends data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, its clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While were at it, we dont need information from all of the columns, so lets create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration. Lets put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now were getting somewhere. Weve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Lets try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so lets try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Lets filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as Children, Stand-Up, and Documentaries. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, well also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use. The latter isnt taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as childrens movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we cant know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, youve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas. We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri Posted in student blogLeave a Comment on Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter?

History of Artificial Intelligence from Academic Roots to Practical Progress AIs origins lie within the academic halls of prestigious university research departments, initially pondered by scholars envisioning computings future. However, its infancy tethered it to these domains, hampered by scarce data and limited computational prowess. A pivotal moment arose in 1956 at Dartmouth College, where the renowned Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence convened. This workshop aimed to validate the notion that machines could simulate learning with precisiona groundbreaking hypothesis explored by 20 researchers. In subsequent years, significant strides marked AIs trajectory. American psychologist Frank Rosenblatts perceptron algorithm, born from Dartmouths research, demonstrated successful binary classification, offering glimpses into artificial neurons learning potential. Concurrently, John McCarthy, an attendee of the Dartmouth project, along with MIT students, pioneered Lisp, a novel programming language laying the groundwork for future advancements like the SHRDLU natural language program and others. The 1960s witnessed the emergence of Simulmatics, a company claiming to predict voting patterns based on demographics. By 1965, expert systems surfaced, allowing AI to tackle specialized problems using factual databases and inference engines. MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaums Eliza in 1966 showcased AIs intelligence by engaging users as pseudo-therapists, responding to their inputs with open-ended questions. However, by the mid-1970s, dwindling faith in AI among governments and corporations led to funding shortages, marking the onset of the AI winter. Despite brief revivals in the 1980s and 1990s, AI remained largely relegated to science fiction, steering clear of serious computer science discourse. It wasnt until the late 1990s and early 2000s that AI saw widespread adoption of machine learning techniques, including Bayesian methods from spam filtering by Microsoft and collaborative filtering for Amazon recommendations, marking a resurgence in AIs practical applications. AI in the 21st Century: Revolutionary Pilot Programs and Real-world Applications During the 2000s, a confluence of factors, including increased computing power, expansive datasets, and the ascent of open-source software, empowered developers to engineer advanced algorithms. This technological wave promised swift and transformative change across scientific, consumer, manufacturing, and business sectors within a remarkably brief period. Today, AI is an integral part of numerous business operations, attaining tangible reality. For instance, McKinseys research highlights a staggering 400 instances where companies actively leverage AI to tackle various business challenges. These real-world applications of AI exemplify its widespread adoption and effectiveness in addressing multifaceted business issues. Likewise, in the early to mid-2000s web revolution introduced significant changes to AI research. Foundational technologies like Extensible Markup Language XML and Googles PageRank altered data organization, facilitating AI integration. XML played a crucial role in shaping the semantic web and bolstering search engine capabilities, while PageRank redefined web organization.

https://sunway.edu.np/2025/02/#masthead,February 2025 - Sunway College Kathmandu,,,"Month: February 2025 How Nepals Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS Could Impact Students: A Closer Look Posted on February 21, 2025February 21, 2025 by admin In a move that has sparked significant discussion across various sectors, the Nepalese government recently presented the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS in the National Assembly. Tabled by the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, the Bill aims to regulate the growing use of social media platforms, holding users and operators accountable for their actions. While the government cites its goal of promoting social goodwill, cultural tolerance, and good governance, there are growing concerns about how this Bill will impact students, particularly in terms of their freedom of expression and online engagement. Understanding the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BSThe bill seeks to establish clear guidelines for social media operators and users, focusing on ensuring a safe and secure digital environment. Among its key provisions, it outlines the following:Licensing for Digital Platforms: Companies or institutions operating digital platforms will need to obtain a license, valid for two years, to run social media sites in Nepal. Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to the revocation of their operating license. Content Regulations: The Bill targets cyberbullying, identity theft, misinformation, hate speech, deep fake videos, and other harmful digital behaviors. It also aims to control the spread of content that could jeopardize national peace, security, or sovereignty. Fines and Penalties: Users who engage in harmful online activities such as trolling, spreading false information, or engaging in online harassment could face fines of up to Rs 500,000. This would affect students who are active on social media platforms, potentially limiting their ability to express themselves freely. How Will This Affect Nepalese Students? Impact on Freedom of ExpressionOne of the main concerns about the bill is its potential effect on freedom of speech and expression. While the governments intention is to curb harmful content, such as hate speech and cyberbullying, there is worry that the broad nature of the regulations could also suppress legitimate expression. For students who use social media to engage in activism, academic discussions, or even personal expression, the fear of unwarranted censorship or punishment could lead to self-censorship and limited discourse online. Education and LearningMany students rely on social media platforms for educational content, online courses, webinars, and knowledge-sharing. However, the new Bills stringent content regulations could restrict access to certain types of content or make platforms overly cautious about the content they allow. Students who use YouTube, LinkedIn, and other social media for professional networking, learning, and career growth might find themselves limited by the need for companies to censor certain types of content to comply with the Bill. Online Privacy and Data SecurityOne of the Bills main selling points is its promise to improve information security, privacy of personal data, and cyber security. While this is an encouraging development, students will need to remain vigilant about their online footprint. The fear of stricter regulations could cause students to reconsider how much personal information they share on social media, which could have implications for those looking to build their online presence, especially for career networking or self-branding. Fines and AccountabilityWith fines of up to Rs 500,000 for users who engage in online activities deemed harmful, students may feel more apprehensive about their interactions on social media. The Bills broad scope, covering actions such as posting, liking, commenting, or tagging with the wrong intention, means that students could be penalized for actions that may seem innocuous or unintentional. This could make students more cautious, reducing their willingness to participate in conversations or share content freely. A Changing Social Media LandscapeThe implementation of the Social Media Council Bill will undoubtedly reshape the way social media operates in Nepal. With stricter regulations on digital platforms, students may find themselves navigating a more controlled online space. This could impact everything from group discussions, student activism, and university-related social media projects to career-building efforts on platforms like LinkedIn. It may also push students to look for new, alternative platforms to communicate or organize, especially if they feel stifled by existing social media regulations. Conclusion: Adapting to a New Digital EnvironmentAs Nepal moves forward with the Social Media Council Bill, students will need to adjust to the new reality of a more regulated digital space. While the intent of the Bill is to foster a safer, more secure online environment, students must stay informed about how the new regulations will affect their digital interactions. Understanding the implications of the Bill will help students protect their rights to freedom of expression, navigate the new rules on digital conduct, and continue using social media platforms in a responsible and creative way.

Posted on July 30, 2023July 30, 2023 by admin Generative AI revolutionizes the creative process by allowing humans to supervise while machines generate. This shift relieves us from tedious, risky, and challenging tasks, enabling us to concentrate on the core aspects of our work: vision, ideas, and purpose. It represents a transformative change in the future of employment. Importance of Generative AI Generative AI, like photography and celluloid film, represents an incredible creative revolution. It reduces the necessity for creative skill in painting or singing, just as photography emancipated us from relying entirely on artists to depict the truth. The influence of Generative AI goes beyond creativity, giving rapid access to clear information and the automatic development of varied material such as news stories, product descriptions, bespoke designs, music, visual effects, and more. It is redefining not only specialized professions as well as our view of work, as AI models increasingly aid with repetitive or computational activities in the manufacturing process. How is Generative AI different from other AI? In contrast to other forms of artificial intelligence, generative AI focuses on producing new material, whereas discriminative AI classifies existing data. Generative AI is used for picture production, video synthesis, language generation, and music composition. It is one of the subcategories of artificial intelligence that encompasses various activities done by AI systems. Reactive machines for self-driving cars, limited memory AI for weather forecasting, theory of mind for virtual customer assistance, narrow AI for personalized product suggestions in e-commerce, supervised learning for object identification, unsupervised learning for fraud detection in banking, and reinforcement learning for teaching machines to play games are all examples of these tasks. Generative AI encompasses several of these areas and continues to grow, with its primary goal being the production of new material, whether writing, graphics, or product suggestions. How Generative AI works? To recognize patterns and produce new results, generative AI employs techniques such as neural networks and deep learning algorithms. It learns the basic principles guiding the content by studying a vast dataset. It generates fresh data by sampling from a previously learned distribution. The model refines the output to fit the desired outcome through a process known as inference, making it more realistic and aligned with user preferences. Generative AI Models 1. Natural Language Model Natural Language Model is the most well-known model of Generative AI, with ChatGPT making headlines. The majority of the excitement around text-based Generative AI is centered on a model known as GPT-3. Its a language model created by OpenAI, a research group dedicated to the development and promotion of friendly AI. For example, while computers cannot understand language in the same way that humans can, natural language technologies are becoming more effective at identifying the context and meaning of phrases and words and converting them into suitable responsesand actions. 2. Generative Adversarial Networks GANs Generative Adversarial Networks GANs are a well-known form of Generative AI. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator that work together to enhance the generators ability to generate realistic data. Over time, the generator improves its capacity to synthesize lifelike data, resulting in the creation of new items, assets, faces, and even people. GANs can be utilized for various applications, including generating natural features such as lightning, leaves, roots, eyes, and flowers, as well as seamlessly integrating humans with nature. Furthermore, in the context of financial fraud detection, GAN models can generate synthetic fraudulent transactions to train fraud detection algorithms. 3. VAE and Anomaly Detection Variational Autoencoders VAE are a major model used for anomaly identification. It entails training the model on a collection of normal data and then utilizing it to detect occurrences that deviate from the norm. VAE has applications in a variety of fields, including financial fraud detection, discovering defects in manufacturing processes, and detecting network breaches. For example, Google has used VAE to identify network attacks. Future Prediction Generative AI will continue to play a critical role in computer graphics, animation, and 3D modeling in the gaming, film, and marketing industries. It will also be employed in the next decade or so to improve virtual assistants and chatbots natural language understanding, allowing them to conduct complicated discussions. In the future, generative AI will help to create realistic simulations in sectors like architecture and engineering, create new materials and products in manufacturing and textile design, and aid in natural language production for news articles, novels, and movie screenplays. Conclusion In terms of utility and predictability, generative AI is similar to a camera, acting as a powerful instrument in the hands of people. Just like a camera performs reliably, generative AI follows the same pattern each time it is used. It enables people to use their skills to generate content, develop new solutions, and explore creative possibilities. Users may leverage the potential of generative AI to improve productivity, accelerate improvements, and stimulate discoveries by understanding and utilizing its consistent nature.

Posted on July 26, 2023January 26, 2024 by admin Threads is a social networking software developed by Meta, which created Instagram and Facebook. Threads allow you to see a feed of everything thats going on with your friends or persons youre interested in. You may also upload messages, text, images, and videos. You might also respond to or like messages. Threads Vs Twitter Twitter has increased the number of advertisements that appear after one out of every five postings. An individual has a large number of bot accounts and improper accounts that need to be detected. Twitter charges for verification, risking fake paid Elon Musk accounts. Limited daily tweets can be viewed unless users pay to increase the limit. Threads aims to counter negative sentiment toward Twitter meta, explicitly stating no monetization until the app hits a billion users. How do Threads work? Theyve adjusted it so that everyone must have an Instagram account before theyre able to sign up, which has significantly reduced the degree of Bot activity. Because its linked to your Instagram account, you wont have to pay for verification, and it will automatically transfer from your Instagram to your Threads account. Threads unexpected buzz makes it seem like everyone is already there, a challenge for new platforms. When one of your Instagram followers signs up for Threads, they automatically follow you, giving the user a huge boost in enthusiasm. As a result, threads seem like this New Haven is like a fresh start on Twitter. Because of his superb timing and some big-brain marketing, Mark Zuckerberg has become the new Peoples Choice hero. Theyve also figured out how to develop an enormous fear of missing out among those on the outside. Registering quickly for a Threads account earns you a rating, akin to a race assessment. What makes Twitter differ from Threads? Threads vs Twitter Twitters unique focus on news fosters real-time discussions, allowing users to engage and learn about global events and perspectives. The app Threads faces a data issue, as it currently does not comply with the strict data laws of the European Union. Automatic Status Sharing The software also introduces the notion of automated status sharing, which allows users to automatically share their activities and locations. Threads intelligently recognize and share information about a users current status, such as location, movement, or even the music they are listening to, using powerful AI algorithms. While these capabilities may raise privacy concerns for some users, the app assures that users control information sharing, emphasizing transparency and consent. Conclusion Threads intended to debut in a minimal, stable state for V1, resembling Twitter with deliberate Instagram design aspects. Moreover, it is appropriately called since users have begun to refer to Threads as strings of messages, and its straightforward, with your newsfeed consisting of individuals you follow and those you dont. It nails the basicsvisually appealing, runs smoothly, almost bug-freemaking it a less overwhelming alternative to Twitter.

Posted in UncategorizedLeave a Comment on All you need to know about BSc Hons Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Scope  Placements  Career How does the For You algorithm work in TikTok? Posted on October 13, 2022June 9, 2023 by admin Have you ever wondered how the TikTok algorithm work? Let us review and understand. TikTok is addictive. It is so addictive that 9 out of 10 users on TikTok use it daily for hours. How do we spend hours on TikTok, even if its a short-content platform? Lets understand how the TikTok For You algorithm works. We will also cover how the basic recommendation algorithm works. Working of TikTok For You Page Recommendation Algorithm Before going in depth on how the TikTok algorithm works, let us understand the metadata. Metadata is the data that provides information about the data. This data helps identify and categorize the content for various backend purposes. Metadata of TikTok Videos Hashtags Hashtags are a few phrases attached to the end of the captions so they can help the algorithm understand the content type. The video uploader usually chooses this. Hashtags are better for a new content creator because they help TikTok identify the type of content theyre uploading. Music TikToks are frequently associated with music. TikTok made a significant move by using copyrighted music as a streaming platform, allowing creators to attach sounds without fear of copyright infringement. The music we choose for a TikTok video categorizes it as well, making it one of the more important pieces of metadata. Content-Duration TikTok is slowly increasing its video content duration limit. The platform started with a 15-second video uploaded over 10 minutes today. The length of the video also categorizes it, making it metadata for a TikTok video. Creator The creator uploading the content is by far the most critical metadata to categorize TikTok videos. Similarly, other metadata such as uploaded time, location, date, and video quality are a few other examples of metadata for a TikTok video. Consumer Ratings on TikTok When a video is released, TikTok usually sends it to all of its active users at once, who are usually chosen based on the metadata of the video that they are watching. Implicit Ratings Implicit ratings are ratings that occur as a result of behavior and cannot be faked by the user. For example, ordering a product from an online store. A few implicit ratings for TikTok videos are: View Time: During the initial video shoot, TikTok closely monitors the average watch duration of the video. There is a trend of looping a TikTok video so that the end can be unnoticed; the clever creator does it so that the watch duration exceeds the actual content duration, signaling the TikTok algorithm. Video Skips: A video viewer usually skips a video when they dont like it. This can be an important signal for TikTok to stop recommending the video that has been skipped and instead recommend some other content category. Profile Visit When consumers like the video, they usually visit the creators profile. This can count as an implicit rating as the user is indicating that they like the creator and want to consume similar content. Explicit Ratings Explicit ratings are the ratings that the user explicitly creates, which means theres some effort in creating explicit ratings. For example, liking a TikTok video A few explicit ratings for TikTok videos are: Likes: The user usually double-taps when they like the content, this helps to increase the likes count for a video and helps the algorithm. Comments: A comment on a video can act as a powerful explicit rating if there is more time and effort required to do so. Shares: Shares are also one of the most powerful explicit ratings as it is one of the rarest ratings, and parallelly, it also creates more exposure for the content. How TikTok algorithm work in recommended videos? As we have understood all the following terms, now we can understand how TikTok algorithm work to recommended videos. Step 1: The user uploads the video, and TikTok takes a few minutes to understand the content based on metadata. Step 2: TikTok distributes the video to a few active users in order to collect preliminary consumption data. Step 3: TikTok typically suggests the video to users who are watching other similarly category videos based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video. Step 4: Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. In conclusion, TikTok is a video-editing app that sends videos to a few active users to collect initial consumption results. Based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video, TikTok usually recommends the content to users who are consuming similar videos. Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. A message from the Sunway Social media and its uses have spread like wildfire lately.

https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog/#masthead,student blog Archives - Sunway College Kathmandu,,,"Category: student blog Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter? Posted on September 27, 2023September 27, 2023 by Simoli Desai I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and Im excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, its not that straightforward.  Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, its essential to note that not all genres are following this trend. Heres what I discovered:  Decline in Length: Genres like Childrens and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content.  Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friends data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainmentmedia company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If were going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first well need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Lets start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. Well also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Lets perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friends assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friends aggregations, were limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path datasetsnetflix_data.csv. Lets create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friends data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, its clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While were at it, we dont need information from all of the columns, so lets create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration. Lets put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now were getting somewhere. Weve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Lets try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so lets try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Lets filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as Children, Stand-Up, and Documentaries. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, well also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use. The latter isnt taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as childrens movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we cant know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, youve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas. We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri Posted in student blogLeave a Comment on Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter? Automatic Panipuri Water Dispenser At Sunway College Posted on August 26, 2022November 11, 2022 by admin At Sunway College Kathmandu, our IT and research club has developed a creative IoT Based Water dispenser. The Automatic Panipuri Water Dispenser senses when we place a puri below its dispenser pipe, the devices sense the object and fill the puri with a flavored panipuri drink. This gadget has been the pride of Sunway college and also a major source of attraction at different events. Lets know more details on the devices used, the building process, and the working mechanism of this tech from our student Sabin Shrestha. Hello, my name is Sabin Shrestha, and Im now enrolled in the third semester at Sunway College Kathmandu, Nepal. There are many automated devices developed and researched today utilizing IoT. IoT has already made life simpler for us in several ways. It greatly influences how we live our daily lives. However, this initiative is just another one that solicits donations. The project is an automated Panipuri water dispenser, as one would assume from the name. What actually is an Automatic Panipuri Water Dispenser? An automated PaniPuri water dispenser is a gadget that delivers flavored water in specified amounts by automatically sensing the Puri without manual effort. The panipuris flavored water is dispensed using this technique. The system uses electronic components such as an Arduino, a breadboard, a jumper, a relay, and an adjustable IR sensor. The system works on the straightforward premise of detecting an item beneath the sensor and signaling the relay to activate the switch. Devices used Keywords: Arduino, IoT, Relay, Adjustable IR Sensor Benefits of automatic water dispenser Not just for panipuri, this device is usable in many fields. Below are a few benefits of having an automatic water dispenser: Portable Less amount of human effort Fetch the flavored water automatically Less use of the hand. Conventional Increase sales Working Process of the Automatic Panipuri Water Dispenser The device follows 5 different steps to dispense flavored water. Lets break it down and understand. Turn on the device Sense Objects Arduino receives data from the sensor Transmits signals to the relay to turn on the dispenser Fetch flavored water. Methodology of developing an automatic water dispenser The methodology consists of the following steps for making this project real: Research and survey: Research is crucial to any project. Before starting this project, first and foremost we researched past works, designs, and projects. Other, comparable devices, such as automatic sanitizers, have been the subject of research. System Design: In system design, we design the device considering its architecture, shape, and size. Also, We also list out the components for the system and plan the system operation and hardware requirements for the project. Additionally, we designed a 3D print. Software Implementation In the software implementation process, we create Arduino code in the Arduino IDE according to the design and upload the code to Arduino for prototyping and testing. Prototyping  Testing In, Prototyping and testing phase, we test the working of the device with a small developed prototype. Device and component integration: After the prototype, we integrate all devices and components per design and code. The materials such as Arduino, an Adjustable IR Sensor, jumper wires, wires, a USB charger, pipe, wiring strips, 12 v chargers, stalls, etc. Data collection  Analysis In this stage, we gather data and analyze it as necessary. From our analysis, we found, that the object should be 56 cm away to sense by the system. And, It takes 3 seconds to get the flavor-infused water from the bucket once the thing is discovered. Result In the result phase, we gather the outcome. As a consequence, we validate if the system operates as intended. Although the dispenser has to be cleaned every day while it is in use. But the good thing is, This project is working and put into action effectively. Conclusion The Automated Panipuri water dispenser is a gadget that senses the Puri and automatically fetches the flavor-infused water. This method can be handy in restaurants, cafes, hotels, etc. Moreover, the gadget has several benefits as we discussed, and is frequently used for automated dispensing in Nepal and other nations too.

Data Science and Artificial Intelligence  A career that never ends IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor by Sabin Shrestha Posted on August 5, 2022November 11, 2022 by admin At Sunway College, we have a dedicated research lab Sunway College Research Lab where we focus on experimenting and researching different IoT-based devices. Our mini research is also one of the most loved workplaces for some of our robotic geeks. We provide drones, 3D printers, and other essentials that our students request for their research. One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha and team have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself. Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at Sunway College Kathmandu March 2021 Intake. Lets have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor. Water Heating: Till Now Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more. There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences. In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? The rise of IoT Internet of Things is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term Internet of Things IoT describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. Theres usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 Temperature-Humidity Sensor Bread Board DS18B20 Water Temperature Sensor Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil  Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, lets understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the projects outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result  Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ides serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometers serial monitor is compared. Acknowledgment I would like to express my warm thank you to Sunway College Kathmandu as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project. Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of Sunway College Kathmandu. I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more. The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway Colleges research lab and beyond that.

Posted in BlogLeave a Comment on Study in Nepal with ECAN SoftEd IT Scholarship Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter? Posted on September 27, 2023September 27, 2023 by Simoli Desai I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and Im excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, its not that straightforward.  Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, its essential to note that not all genres are following this trend. Heres what I discovered:  Decline in Length: Genres like Childrens and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content.  Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friends data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainmentmedia company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If were going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first well need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Lets start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. Well also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Lets perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friends assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friends aggregations, were limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path datasetsnetflix_data.csv. Lets create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friends data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, its clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While were at it, we dont need information from all of the columns, so lets create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration. Lets put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now were getting somewhere. Weve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Lets try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so lets try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Lets filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as Children, Stand-Up, and Documentaries. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, well also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use. The latter isnt taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as childrens movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we cant know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, youve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas. We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri Posted in student blogLeave a Comment on Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter?

Posted in BlogLeave a Comment on Study in Nepal with ECAN SoftEd IT Scholarship Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter? Posted on September 27, 2023September 27, 2023 by Simoli Desai I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and Im excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, its not that straightforward.  Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, its essential to note that not all genres are following this trend. Heres what I discovered:  Decline in Length: Genres like Childrens and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content.  Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friends data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainmentmedia company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If were going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first well need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Lets start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. Well also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Lets perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friends assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friends aggregations, were limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path datasetsnetflix_data.csv. Lets create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friends data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, its clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While were at it, we dont need information from all of the columns, so lets create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration. Lets put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now were getting somewhere. Weve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Lets try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so lets try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Lets filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as Children, Stand-Up, and Documentaries. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, well also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use. The latter isnt taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as childrens movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we cant know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, youve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas. We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri Posted in student blogLeave a Comment on Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter?

Posted in BlogLeave a Comment on Study in Nepal with ECAN SoftEd IT Scholarship Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter? Posted on September 27, 2023September 27, 2023 by Simoli Desai I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and Im excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, its not that straightforward.  Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, its essential to note that not all genres are following this trend. Heres what I discovered:  Decline in Length: Genres like Childrens and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content.  Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience. Further Exploration: 1. Loading your friends data into a dictionary Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainmentmedia company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021. Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining. As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively. If were going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first well need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Lets start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary! 2. Creating a DataFrame from a dictionary To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. Well also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Lets perform these steps now. 3. A visual inspection of our data Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friends assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data. Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so. Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python. 4. Loading the rest of the data from a CSV Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friends aggregations, were limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including: What does this trend look like over a longer period of time? Is this explainable by something like the genre of entertainment? Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path datasetsnetflix_data.csv. Lets create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friends data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows. 5. Filtering for movies! Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths. Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, its clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons? Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While were at it, we dont need information from all of the columns, so lets create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration. Lets put our data subsetting skills to work! 6. Creating a scatter plot Okay, now were getting somewhere. Weve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Lets try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time. This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so lets try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis. 7. Digging deeper This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades. Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Lets filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average. 8. Marking non-feature films Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as Children, Stand-Up, and Documentaries. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster. We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color. In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color! Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here! 9. Plotting with color! Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies. This time, well also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use. The latter isnt taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here! 10. What next? Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as childrens movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we cant know for certain until we perform additional analyses. Congratulations, youve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas. We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey! -Bishesh Giri Posted in student blogLeave a Comment on Analyzing Netflix Movie Trends: Are Movies Getting Shorter?

https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/#masthead,"Simoli Desai, Author at Sunway College Kathmandu",,,"Author: Simoli Desai For AI Enthusiasts: A Fascinating Journey Through the History of Artificial Intelligence Posted on January 4, 2024February 14, 2025 by Simoli Desai Upon hearing the term Artificial Intelligence, many immediately picture familiar virtual assistants such as Alexa and Siri, advanced technologies like ChatGPT, or iconic portrayals from movies like The Terminator or TV series such as the Kdrama My Holo Love. These instances often align with a narrow but prevalent perspective on AI, encapsulating contemporary innovations and cultural references that shape the ongoing history of artificial intelligence. Artificial Intelligence AI isnt merely a futuristic idea confined to sci-fi realms; its a pervasive part of our everyday experiences. Whether its the personalized recommendations on streaming platforms like Netflix or the optimized routes suggested by ride-sharing services such as Pathao, AI permeates various aspects of modern life. This intricate ecosystem of interconnected technologies has steadily evolved over decades, contributing to its current complexity and ubiquity. Understanding the history of AI unveils a layered narrative, showcasing the diverse tools and capabilities that have molded it into the game-changing force it represents today. Tracing the trajectory of AIs development is key to comprehending its present importance and preparing for its future implications. By examining its origins and evolutionary path, we gain valuable insights into how AI has transformed from a conceptual idea into a transformative technology that profoundly influences our daily routines and shapes industries across the spectrum. grasping the past paves the way for harnessing the potential of AI in our ever-evolving world. History of Artificial Intelligence from Academic Roots to Practical Progress AIs origins lie within the academic halls of prestigious university research departments, initially pondered by scholars envisioning computings future. However, its infancy tethered it to these domains, hampered by scarce data and limited computational prowess. A pivotal moment arose in 1956 at Dartmouth College, where the renowned Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence convened. This workshop aimed to validate the notion that machines could simulate learning with precisiona groundbreaking hypothesis explored by 20 researchers. In subsequent years, significant strides marked AIs trajectory. American psychologist Frank Rosenblatts perceptron algorithm, born from Dartmouths research, demonstrated successful binary classification, offering glimpses into artificial neurons learning potential. Concurrently, John McCarthy, an attendee of the Dartmouth project, along with MIT students, pioneered Lisp, a novel programming language laying the groundwork for future advancements like the SHRDLU natural language program and others. The 1960s witnessed the emergence of Simulmatics, a company claiming to predict voting patterns based on demographics. By 1965, expert systems surfaced, allowing AI to tackle specialized problems using factual databases and inference engines. MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaums Eliza in 1966 showcased AIs intelligence by engaging users as pseudo-therapists, responding to their inputs with open-ended questions. However, by the mid-1970s, dwindling faith in AI among governments and corporations led to funding shortages, marking the onset of the AI winter. Despite brief revivals in the 1980s and 1990s, AI remained largely relegated to science fiction, steering clear of serious computer science discourse. It wasnt until the late 1990s and early 2000s that AI saw widespread adoption of machine learning techniques, including Bayesian methods from spam filtering by Microsoft and collaborative filtering for Amazon recommendations, marking a resurgence in AIs practical applications. AI in the 21st Century: Revolutionary Pilot Programs and Real-world Applications During the 2000s, a confluence of factors, including increased computing power, expansive datasets, and the ascent of open-source software, empowered developers to engineer advanced algorithms. This technological wave promised swift and transformative change across scientific, consumer, manufacturing, and business sectors within a remarkably brief period. Today, AI is an integral part of numerous business operations, attaining tangible reality. For instance, McKinseys research highlights a staggering 400 instances where companies actively leverage AI to tackle various business challenges. These real-world applications of AI exemplify its widespread adoption and effectiveness in addressing multifaceted business issues. Likewise, in the early to mid-2000s web revolution introduced significant changes to AI research. Foundational technologies like Extensible Markup Language XML and Googles PageRank altered data organization, facilitating AI integration. XML played a crucial role in shaping the semantic web and bolstering search engine capabilities, while PageRank redefined web organization. These innovations enhanced data accessibility for AI, rendering vast amounts of information more navigable. Simultaneously, database improvements in data storage and retrieval, alongside advancements in functional programming languages, streamlined data manipulation for developers and researchers. These combined tools provided a fertile ground for advancing AI technology. Artificial Intelligences Potential: Evolution through Neural Networks and Deep Learning AI held ambitious promises throughout the 20th century, yet limited computing power posed significant barriers to realizing these ambitions. However, as the 21st century dawned, computers underwent an exponential surge in capability, becoming proficient in storing, processing, and analyzing massive volumes of data. This paradigm shift paved the way for translating the ambitious goals of neural networks and deep learning into tangible realities. Researchers made strides by curating datasets explicitly tailored for machine training, culminating in the creation of neural networks like AlexNet. Unlike earlier methods reliant on datasets numbering in the tens of thousands, advancements in graphics processing units GPUs allowed for datasets to reach tens of millions, significantly enhancing machine learning capabilities. In 2006, Nvidia, a leading computer chip manufacturer, introduced CUDA, a parallel computing platform that harnessed the power of GPUs to drastically accelerate computational speeds. This monumental leap facilitated the execution of large, intricate machine-learning models through platforms such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, propelling innovation in the field. As these platforms evolved into open-source libraries, they democratized AI, enabling widespread experimentation. This democratization empowered the inception and growth of groundbreaking tools like AlphaGo, Google DeepMind, and IBM Deep Blue, fostering an era of exciting advancements in artificial intelligence.

https://sunway.edu.np/how-nepals-social-media-council-bill-2081-bs-could-impact-students-a-closer-look/#masthead,"How Nepals Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS Could Impact Students: A Closer Look - Sunway College Kathmandu",2025-02-21T05:10:48+00:00,Sunway College Kathmandu Blog -,"How Nepals Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS Could Impact Students: A Closer Look Posted on February 21, 2025February 21, 2025 by admin In a move that has sparked significant discussion across various sectors, the Nepalese government recently presented the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS in the National Assembly. Tabled by the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, the Bill aims to regulate the growing use of social media platforms, holding users and operators accountable for their actions. While the government cites its goal of promoting social goodwill, cultural tolerance, and good governance, there are growing concerns about how this Bill will impact students, particularly in terms of their freedom of expression and online engagement. Understanding the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BSThe bill seeks to establish clear guidelines for social media operators and users, focusing on ensuring a safe and secure digital environment. Among its key provisions, it outlines the following:Licensing for Digital Platforms: Companies or institutions operating digital platforms will need to obtain a license, valid for two years, to run social media sites in Nepal. Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to the revocation of their operating license. Content Regulations: The Bill targets cyberbullying, identity theft, misinformation, hate speech, deep fake videos, and other harmful digital behaviors. It also aims to control the spread of content that could jeopardize national peace, security, or sovereignty. Fines and Penalties: Users who engage in harmful online activities such as trolling, spreading false information, or engaging in online harassment could face fines of up to Rs 500,000. This would affect students who are active on social media platforms, potentially limiting their ability to express themselves freely. How Will This Affect Nepalese Students? Impact on Freedom of ExpressionOne of the main concerns about the bill is its potential effect on freedom of speech and expression. While the governments intention is to curb harmful content, such as hate speech and cyberbullying, there is worry that the broad nature of the regulations could also suppress legitimate expression. For students who use social media to engage in activism, academic discussions, or even personal expression, the fear of unwarranted censorship or punishment could lead to self-censorship and limited discourse online. Education and LearningMany students rely on social media platforms for educational content, online courses, webinars, and knowledge-sharing. However, the new Bills stringent content regulations could restrict access to certain types of content or make platforms overly cautious about the content they allow. Students who use YouTube, LinkedIn, and other social media for professional networking, learning, and career growth might find themselves limited by the need for companies to censor certain types of content to comply with the Bill. Online Privacy and Data SecurityOne of the Bills main selling points is its promise to improve information security, privacy of personal data, and cyber security. While this is an encouraging development, students will need to remain vigilant about their online footprint. The fear of stricter regulations could cause students to reconsider how much personal information they share on social media, which could have implications for those looking to build their online presence, especially for career networking or self-branding. Fines and AccountabilityWith fines of up to Rs 500,000 for users who engage in online activities deemed harmful, students may feel more apprehensive about their interactions on social media. The Bills broad scope, covering actions such as posting, liking, commenting, or tagging with the wrong intention, means that students could be penalized for actions that may seem innocuous or unintentional. This could make students more cautious, reducing their willingness to participate in conversations or share content freely. A Changing Social Media LandscapeThe implementation of the Social Media Council Bill will undoubtedly reshape the way social media operates in Nepal. With stricter regulations on digital platforms, students may find themselves navigating a more controlled online space. This could impact everything from group discussions, student activism, and university-related social media projects to career-building efforts on platforms like LinkedIn. It may also push students to look for new, alternative platforms to communicate or organize, especially if they feel stifled by existing social media regulations. Conclusion: Adapting to a New Digital EnvironmentAs Nepal moves forward with the Social Media Council Bill, students will need to adjust to the new reality of a more regulated digital space. While the intent of the Bill is to foster a safer, more secure online environment, students must stay informed about how the new regulations will affect their digital interactions. Understanding the implications of the Bill will help students protect their rights to freedom of expression, navigate the new rules on digital conduct, and continue using social media platforms in a responsible and creative way.

Data Science and Artificial Intelligence  A career that never ends IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor by Sabin Shrestha Posted on August 5, 2022November 11, 2022 by admin At Sunway College, we have a dedicated research lab Sunway College Research Lab where we focus on experimenting and researching different IoT-based devices. Our mini research is also one of the most loved workplaces for some of our robotic geeks. We provide drones, 3D printers, and other essentials that our students request for their research. One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha and team have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself. Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at Sunway College Kathmandu March 2021 Intake. Lets have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor. Water Heating: Till Now Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more. There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences. In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? The rise of IoT Internet of Things is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term Internet of Things IoT describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. Theres usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 Temperature-Humidity Sensor Bread Board DS18B20 Water Temperature Sensor Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil  Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, lets understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the projects outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result  Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ides serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometers serial monitor is compared. Acknowledgment I would like to express my warm thank you to Sunway College Kathmandu as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project. Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of Sunway College Kathmandu. I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more. The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway Colleges research lab and beyond that.

Data Science and Artificial Intelligence  A career that never ends IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor by Sabin Shrestha Posted on August 5, 2022November 11, 2022 by admin At Sunway College, we have a dedicated research lab Sunway College Research Lab where we focus on experimenting and researching different IoT-based devices. Our mini research is also one of the most loved workplaces for some of our robotic geeks. We provide drones, 3D printers, and other essentials that our students request for their research. One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha and team have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself. Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at Sunway College Kathmandu March 2021 Intake. Lets have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor. Water Heating: Till Now Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more. There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences. In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? The rise of IoT Internet of Things is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term Internet of Things IoT describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. Theres usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 Temperature-Humidity Sensor Bread Board DS18B20 Water Temperature Sensor Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil  Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, lets understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the projects outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result  Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ides serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometers serial monitor is compared. Acknowledgment I would like to express my warm thank you to Sunway College Kathmandu as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project. Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of Sunway College Kathmandu. I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more. The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway Colleges research lab and beyond that.

Posted in data science, student blogLeave a Comment on What to study after 2? Data Science and Artificial Intelligence  A career that never ends IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor by Sabin Shrestha Posted on August 5, 2022November 11, 2022 by admin At Sunway College, we have a dedicated research lab Sunway College Research Lab where we focus on experimenting and researching different IoT-based devices. Our mini research is also one of the most loved workplaces for some of our robotic geeks. We provide drones, 3D printers, and other essentials that our students request for their research. One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha and team have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself. Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at Sunway College Kathmandu March 2021 Intake. Lets have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor. Water Heating: Till Now Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more. There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences. In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature. As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF. Let us rewind the project from its basics. What is an IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? The rise of IoT Internet of Things is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology. The term Internet of Things IoT describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature. Why did we make an IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor? There are several problems with the manual water heater. Theres usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor. Tools to operate IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor To operate this system, these are the following tools we used: Arduino DHT11 Temperature-Humidity Sensor Bread Board DS18B20 Water Temperature Sensor Jumper Wires Resistor I2C OLED Water Heating Coil  Relay and LED. Applications and Advantages of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more. An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately. Now, lets understand automatic controls and our project. Automatic controls and IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT. IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied. This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20. Development Processes of IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor We have divided the development process into the following steps: Research about the project We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor. Designing and defining pins on Arduino: system pin allocation of IoT-based water temperature adjustor In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated. Mechanical Setup According to design: In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino. Technical Setup for IoT-Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic. In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively. The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically. We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code. Data collection and analysis phase for IoT-Based Water Temperature Adjustor In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy. Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C. Creating prototype and testing: prototype of IoT-based water temperature adjustor Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the projects outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not. Result  Analysis IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically. As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season. The result shown in Arduino ides serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometers serial monitor is compared. Acknowledgment I would like to express my warm thank you to Sunway College Kathmandu as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project. Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of Sunway College Kathmandu. I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality. Conclusion Conclusion? We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more.

https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/#masthead,"admin, Author at Sunway College Kathmandu",,,"Author: admin How Nepals Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS Could Impact Students: A Closer Look Posted on February 21, 2025February 21, 2025 by admin In a move that has sparked significant discussion across various sectors, the Nepalese government recently presented the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BS in the National Assembly. Tabled by the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Prithvi Subba Gurung, the Bill aims to regulate the growing use of social media platforms, holding users and operators accountable for their actions. While the government cites its goal of promoting social goodwill, cultural tolerance, and good governance, there are growing concerns about how this Bill will impact students, particularly in terms of their freedom of expression and online engagement. Understanding the Social Media Council Bill, 2081 BSThe bill seeks to establish clear guidelines for social media operators and users, focusing on ensuring a safe and secure digital environment. Among its key provisions, it outlines the following:Licensing for Digital Platforms: Companies or institutions operating digital platforms will need to obtain a license, valid for two years, to run social media sites in Nepal. Failure to comply with the regulations could lead to the revocation of their operating license. Content Regulations: The Bill targets cyberbullying, identity theft, misinformation, hate speech, deep fake videos, and other harmful digital behaviors. It also aims to control the spread of content that could jeopardize national peace, security, or sovereignty. Fines and Penalties: Users who engage in harmful online activities such as trolling, spreading false information, or engaging in online harassment could face fines of up to Rs 500,000. This would affect students who are active on social media platforms, potentially limiting their ability to express themselves freely. How Will This Affect Nepalese Students? Impact on Freedom of ExpressionOne of the main concerns about the bill is its potential effect on freedom of speech and expression. While the governments intention is to curb harmful content, such as hate speech and cyberbullying, there is worry that the broad nature of the regulations could also suppress legitimate expression. For students who use social media to engage in activism, academic discussions, or even personal expression, the fear of unwarranted censorship or punishment could lead to self-censorship and limited discourse online. Education and LearningMany students rely on social media platforms for educational content, online courses, webinars, and knowledge-sharing. However, the new Bills stringent content regulations could restrict access to certain types of content or make platforms overly cautious about the content they allow. Students who use YouTube, LinkedIn, and other social media for professional networking, learning, and career growth might find themselves limited by the need for companies to censor certain types of content to comply with the Bill. Online Privacy and Data SecurityOne of the Bills main selling points is its promise to improve information security, privacy of personal data, and cyber security. While this is an encouraging development, students will need to remain vigilant about their online footprint. The fear of stricter regulations could cause students to reconsider how much personal information they share on social media, which could have implications for those looking to build their online presence, especially for career networking or self-branding. Fines and AccountabilityWith fines of up to Rs 500,000 for users who engage in online activities deemed harmful, students may feel more apprehensive about their interactions on social media. The Bills broad scope, covering actions such as posting, liking, commenting, or tagging with the wrong intention, means that students could be penalized for actions that may seem innocuous or unintentional. This could make students more cautious, reducing their willingness to participate in conversations or share content freely. A Changing Social Media LandscapeThe implementation of the Social Media Council Bill will undoubtedly reshape the way social media operates in Nepal. With stricter regulations on digital platforms, students may find themselves navigating a more controlled online space. This could impact everything from group discussions, student activism, and university-related social media projects to career-building efforts on platforms like LinkedIn. It may also push students to look for new, alternative platforms to communicate or organize, especially if they feel stifled by existing social media regulations. Conclusion: Adapting to a New Digital EnvironmentAs Nepal moves forward with the Social Media Council Bill, students will need to adjust to the new reality of a more regulated digital space. While the intent of the Bill is to foster a safer, more secure online environment, students must stay informed about how the new regulations will affect their digital interactions. Understanding the implications of the Bill will help students protect their rights to freedom of expression, navigate the new rules on digital conduct, and continue using social media platforms in a responsible and creative way.

Posted in UncategorizedLeave a Comment on All you need to know about BSc Hons Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Scope  Placements  Career How does the For You algorithm work in TikTok? Posted on October 13, 2022June 9, 2023 by admin Have you ever wondered how the TikTok algorithm work? Let us review and understand. TikTok is addictive. It is so addictive that 9 out of 10 users on TikTok use it daily for hours. How do we spend hours on TikTok, even if its a short-content platform? Lets understand how the TikTok For You algorithm works. We will also cover how the basic recommendation algorithm works. Working of TikTok For You Page Recommendation Algorithm Before going in depth on how the TikTok algorithm works, let us understand the metadata. Metadata is the data that provides information about the data. This data helps identify and categorize the content for various backend purposes. Metadata of TikTok Videos Hashtags Hashtags are a few phrases attached to the end of the captions so they can help the algorithm understand the content type. The video uploader usually chooses this. Hashtags are better for a new content creator because they help TikTok identify the type of content theyre uploading. Music TikToks are frequently associated with music. TikTok made a significant move by using copyrighted music as a streaming platform, allowing creators to attach sounds without fear of copyright infringement. The music we choose for a TikTok video categorizes it as well, making it one of the more important pieces of metadata. Content-Duration TikTok is slowly increasing its video content duration limit. The platform started with a 15-second video uploaded over 10 minutes today. The length of the video also categorizes it, making it metadata for a TikTok video. Creator The creator uploading the content is by far the most critical metadata to categorize TikTok videos. Similarly, other metadata such as uploaded time, location, date, and video quality are a few other examples of metadata for a TikTok video. Consumer Ratings on TikTok When a video is released, TikTok usually sends it to all of its active users at once, who are usually chosen based on the metadata of the video that they are watching. Implicit Ratings Implicit ratings are ratings that occur as a result of behavior and cannot be faked by the user. For example, ordering a product from an online store. A few implicit ratings for TikTok videos are: View Time: During the initial video shoot, TikTok closely monitors the average watch duration of the video. There is a trend of looping a TikTok video so that the end can be unnoticed; the clever creator does it so that the watch duration exceeds the actual content duration, signaling the TikTok algorithm. Video Skips: A video viewer usually skips a video when they dont like it. This can be an important signal for TikTok to stop recommending the video that has been skipped and instead recommend some other content category. Profile Visit When consumers like the video, they usually visit the creators profile. This can count as an implicit rating as the user is indicating that they like the creator and want to consume similar content. Explicit Ratings Explicit ratings are the ratings that the user explicitly creates, which means theres some effort in creating explicit ratings. For example, liking a TikTok video A few explicit ratings for TikTok videos are: Likes: The user usually double-taps when they like the content, this helps to increase the likes count for a video and helps the algorithm. Comments: A comment on a video can act as a powerful explicit rating if there is more time and effort required to do so. Shares: Shares are also one of the most powerful explicit ratings as it is one of the rarest ratings, and parallelly, it also creates more exposure for the content. How TikTok algorithm work in recommended videos? As we have understood all the following terms, now we can understand how TikTok algorithm work to recommended videos. Step 1: The user uploads the video, and TikTok takes a few minutes to understand the content based on metadata. Step 2: TikTok distributes the video to a few active users in order to collect preliminary consumption data. Step 3: TikTok typically suggests the video to users who are watching other similarly category videos based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video. Step 4: Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. In conclusion, TikTok is a video-editing app that sends videos to a few active users to collect initial consumption results. Based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video, TikTok usually recommends the content to users who are consuming similar videos. Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users. A message from the Sunway Social media and its uses have spread like wildfire lately.
