While the government’s intention is to curb harmful content, such as hate speech and cyberbullying, there is worry that the broad nature of the regulations could also suppress legitimate expression. For students who use social media to engage in activism, academic discussions, or even personal expression, the fear of unwarranted censorship or punishment could lead to self-censorship and limited discourse online."

However, the new Bill’s stringent content regulations could restrict access to certain types of content or make platforms overly cautious about the content they allow. Students who use YouTube, LinkedIn, and other social media for professional networking, learning, and career growth might find themselves limited by the need for companies to censor certain types of content to comply with the Bill."
