https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,Have you ever wondered how the TikTok algorithm work? Let us review and understand.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,TikTok is addictive. It is so addictive that 9 out of 10 users on TikTok use it daily for hours.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"How do we spend hours on TikTok, even if it’s a short-content platform?"
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,Let’s understand how the TikTok “For You” algorithm works. We will also cover how the basic recommendation algorithm works.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"Before going in depth on how the TikTok algorithm works, let us understand the metadata. Metadata is the data that provides information about the data. This data helps identify and categorize the content for various backend purposes."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,Hashtags are a few phrases attached to the end of the captions so they can help the algorithm understand the content type. The video uploader usually chooses this. Hashtags are better for a new content creator because they help TikTok identify the type of content they’re uploading.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"TikToks are frequently associated with music. TikTok made a significant move by using copyrighted music as a streaming platform, allowing creators to attach sounds without fear of copyright infringement. The music we choose for a TikTok video categorizes it as well, making it one of the more important pieces of metadata."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"TikTok is slowly increasing its video content duration limit. The platform started with a 15-second video uploaded over 10 minutes today. The length of the video also categorizes it, making it metadata for a TikTok video."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,The creator uploading the content is by far the most critical metadata to categorize TikTok videos.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"Similarly, other metadata such as uploaded time, location, date, and video quality are a few other examples of metadata for a TikTok video."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"When a video is released, TikTok usually sends it to all of its active users at once, who are usually chosen based on the metadata of the video that they are watching."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"Implicit ratings are ratings that occur as a result of behavior and cannot be faked by the user. For example, ordering a product from an online store."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,A few implicit ratings for TikTok videos are:
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,View Time:
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"During the initial video shoot, TikTok closely monitors the average watch duration of the video. There is a trend of looping a TikTok video so that the end can be unnoticed; the clever creator does it so that the watch duration exceeds the actual content duration, signaling the TikTok algorithm."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,Video Skips:
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,A video viewer usually skips a video when they don’t like it. This can be an important signal for TikTok to stop recommending the video that has been skipped and instead recommend some other content category.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,Profile Visit
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"When consumers like the video, they usually visit the creator’s profile. This can count as an implicit rating as the user is indicating that they like the creator and want to consume similar content."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"Explicit ratings are the ratings that the user explicitly creates, which means there’s some effort in creating explicit ratings. For example, liking a TikTok video"
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,A few explicit ratings for TikTok videos are:
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,Likes:
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"The user usually double-taps when they like the content, this helps to increase the likes count for a video and helps the algorithm."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,Comments:
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,A comment on a video can act as a powerful explicit rating if there is more time and effort required to do so.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,Shares:
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"Shares are also one of the most powerful explicit ratings as it is one of the rarest ratings, and parallelly, it also creates more exposure for the content."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"As we have understood all the following terms, now we can understand how TikTok algorithm work to  recommended videos."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"Step 1: The user uploads the video, and TikTok takes a few minutes to understand the content based on metadata."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,Step 2: TikTok distributes the video to a few active users in order to collect preliminary consumption data.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,Step 3: TikTok typically suggests the video to users who are watching other similarly category videos based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"Step 4: Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"In conclusion, TikTok is a video-editing app that sends videos to a few active users to collect initial consumption results. Based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video, TikTok usually recommends the content to users who are consuming similar videos. Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin,"Social media and its uses have spread like wildfire lately. People are out and about promoting themselves, their products and services, and their way of life, whether for business or personal reasons. This is what is seen as the new normal for many.

This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately.
https://sunway.edu.np/iot-based-automatic-water-temperature-adjustor-by-sabin-shrestha,"Now, let’s understand automatic controls and our project."
https://sunway.edu.np/iot-based-automatic-water-temperature-adjustor-by-sabin-shrestha,"Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT."
https://sunway.edu.np/iot-based-automatic-water-temperature-adjustor-by-sabin-shrestha,IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied.
https://sunway.edu.np/iot-based-automatic-water-temperature-adjustor-by-sabin-shrestha,"This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20."
https://sunway.edu.np/iot-based-automatic-water-temperature-adjustor-by-sabin-shrestha,We have divided the development process into the following steps:
https://sunway.edu.np/iot-based-automatic-water-temperature-adjustor-by-sabin-shrestha,"We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor."
https://sunway.edu.np/iot-based-automatic-water-temperature-adjustor-by-sabin-shrestha,"In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated."
https://sunway.edu.np/iot-based-automatic-water-temperature-adjustor-by-sabin-shrestha,"In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino."
https://sunway.edu.np/iot-based-automatic-water-temperature-adjustor-by-sabin-shrestha,"In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic."
https://sunway.edu.np/iot-based-automatic-water-temperature-adjustor-by-sabin-shrestha,"In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively."
https://sunway.edu.np/iot-based-automatic-water-temperature-adjustor-by-sabin-shrestha,"The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically."
https://sunway.edu.np/iot-based-automatic-water-temperature-adjustor-by-sabin-shrestha,We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code.
https://sunway.edu.np/iot-based-automatic-water-temperature-adjustor-by-sabin-shrestha,"In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data.

https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and I’m excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, it’s not that straightforward."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"🍿 Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, it’s essential to note that not all genres are following this trend."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,Here’s what I discovered:
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"📉 Decline in Length: Genres like Children’s and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"📈 Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"If we’re going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first we’ll need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Let’s start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary!"
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. We’ll also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Let’s perform these steps now."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friend’s assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friend’s aggregations, we’re limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including:"
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path ""datasets/netflix_data.csv"". Let’s create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friend’s data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, it’s clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show (perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons)?"
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While we’re at it, we don’t need information from all of the columns, so let’s create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,Let’s put our data subsetting skills to work!
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Okay, now we’re getting somewhere. We’ve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Let’s try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so let’s try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Let’s filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as “Children”, “Stand-Up”, and “Documentaries”. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color!"
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here!"
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"This time, we’ll also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use(). The latter isn’t taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here!"
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as children’s movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we can’t know for certain until we perform additional analyses."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Congratulations, you’ve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey!"

https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"In this stage, we gather data and analyze it as necessary. From our analysis, we found, that the object should be 5–6 cm away to sense by the system. And, It takes 3 seconds to get the flavor-infused water from the bucket once the thing is discovered."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"In the result phase, we gather the outcome. As a consequence, we validate if the system operates as intended. Although the dispenser has to be cleaned every day while it is in use. But the good thing is, This project is working and put into action effectively."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"The Automated Panipuri water dispenser is a gadget that senses the Puri and automatically fetches the flavor-infused water.

https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"At Sunway College, we have a dedicated research lab (Sunway College Research Lab) where we focus on experimenting and researching different IoT-based devices. Our mini research is also one of the most loved workplaces for some of our robotic geeks. We provide drones, 3D printers, and other essentials that our students request for their research.  One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha (and team) have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at Sunway College Kathmandu (March 2021 Intake). Let’s have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,Let us rewind the project from its basics.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,The rise of IoT (Internet of Things) is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system ‘IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor’ is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"There are several problems with the manual water heater. There’s usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"To operate this system, these are the following tools we used:"
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Now, let’s understand automatic controls and our project."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,We have divided the development process into the following steps:
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy.  Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the project’s outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season.  The result shown in Arduino ide’s serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometer’s serial monitor is compared."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,I would like to express my warm thank you to Sunway College Kathmandu as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of Sunway College Kathmandu. I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,Conclusion?
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,"The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/student-blog,The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway College’s research lab and beyond that.

https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and I’m excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, it’s not that straightforward."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"🍿 Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, it’s essential to note that not all genres are following this trend."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,Here’s what I discovered:
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"📉 Decline in Length: Genres like Children’s and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"📈 Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"If we’re going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first we’ll need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Let’s start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary!"
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. We’ll also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Let’s perform these steps now."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friend’s assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friend’s aggregations, we’re limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including:"
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path ""datasets/netflix_data.csv"". Let’s create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friend’s data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, it’s clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show (perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons)?"
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While we’re at it, we don’t need information from all of the columns, so let’s create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,Let’s put our data subsetting skills to work!
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Okay, now we’re getting somewhere. We’ve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Let’s try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so let’s try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Let’s filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as “Children”, “Stand-Up”, and “Documentaries”. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color!"
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here!"
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"This time, we’ll also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use(). The latter isn’t taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here!"
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as children’s movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we can’t know for certain until we perform additional analyses."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"Congratulations, you’ve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas."
https://sunway.edu.np/analyzing-netflix-movie-trends-are-movies-getting-shorter,"We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey!"

https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"The scholarship amount will be based on the student’s IELTS scores, as follows:"
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,I am guessing you are wondering about the fee structure too.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"What’s more, you must have taken and passed the IELTS test within the last two years, so you must present documentation of your results in order to be eligible for the scholarship. The scholarship will be awarded to a small number of students and will be based on both academic excellence and financial need."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,Because this is a UK degree and the criteria are established by Birmingham City University (BCU).
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"I want to be clear about why you should care about having strong academic English before I continue. I’m assuming you’ve already completed an English proficiency test, so you already have a basic understanding of its significance."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"Firstly, Academic English is the language used in academic contexts including colleges, research facilities, and business conventions. It is a formal and specialized form of communication that is important for the academic and professional settings."

https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,Have you ever wondered how the TikTok algorithm work? Let us review and understand.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,TikTok is addictive. It is so addictive that 9 out of 10 users on TikTok use it daily for hours.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"How do we spend hours on TikTok, even if it’s a short-content platform?"
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,Let’s understand how the TikTok “For You” algorithm works. We will also cover how the basic recommendation algorithm works.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"Before going in depth on how the TikTok algorithm works, let us understand the metadata. Metadata is the data that provides information about the data. This data helps identify and categorize the content for various backend purposes."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,Hashtags are a few phrases attached to the end of the captions so they can help the algorithm understand the content type. The video uploader usually chooses this. Hashtags are better for a new content creator because they help TikTok identify the type of content they’re uploading.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"TikToks are frequently associated with music. TikTok made a significant move by using copyrighted music as a streaming platform, allowing creators to attach sounds without fear of copyright infringement. The music we choose for a TikTok video categorizes it as well, making it one of the more important pieces of metadata."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"TikTok is slowly increasing its video content duration limit. The platform started with a 15-second video uploaded over 10 minutes today. The length of the video also categorizes it, making it metadata for a TikTok video."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,The creator uploading the content is by far the most critical metadata to categorize TikTok videos.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"Similarly, other metadata such as uploaded time, location, date, and video quality are a few other examples of metadata for a TikTok video."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"When a video is released, TikTok usually sends it to all of its active users at once, who are usually chosen based on the metadata of the video that they are watching."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"Implicit ratings are ratings that occur as a result of behavior and cannot be faked by the user. For example, ordering a product from an online store."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,A few implicit ratings for TikTok videos are:
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,View Time:
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"During the initial video shoot, TikTok closely monitors the average watch duration of the video. There is a trend of looping a TikTok video so that the end can be unnoticed; the clever creator does it so that the watch duration exceeds the actual content duration, signaling the TikTok algorithm."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,Video Skips:
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,A video viewer usually skips a video when they don’t like it. This can be an important signal for TikTok to stop recommending the video that has been skipped and instead recommend some other content category.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,Profile Visit
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"When consumers like the video, they usually visit the creator’s profile. This can count as an implicit rating as the user is indicating that they like the creator and want to consume similar content."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"Explicit ratings are the ratings that the user explicitly creates, which means there’s some effort in creating explicit ratings. For example, liking a TikTok video"
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,A few explicit ratings for TikTok videos are:
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,Likes:
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"The user usually double-taps when they like the content, this helps to increase the likes count for a video and helps the algorithm."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,Comments:
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,A comment on a video can act as a powerful explicit rating if there is more time and effort required to do so.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,Shares:
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"Shares are also one of the most powerful explicit ratings as it is one of the rarest ratings, and parallelly, it also creates more exposure for the content."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"As we have understood all the following terms, now we can understand how TikTok algorithm work to  recommended videos."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"Step 1: The user uploads the video, and TikTok takes a few minutes to understand the content based on metadata."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,Step 2: TikTok distributes the video to a few active users in order to collect preliminary consumption data.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,Step 3: TikTok typically suggests the video to users who are watching other similarly category videos based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video.
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"Step 4: Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"In conclusion, TikTok is a video-editing app that sends videos to a few active users to collect initial consumption results. Based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video, TikTok usually recommends the content to users who are consuming similar videos. Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"Social media and its uses have spread like wildfire lately. People are out and about promoting themselves, their products and services, and their way of life, whether for business or personal reasons. This is what is seen as the new normal for many. The study of social media and its utilization is important for making the most of this powerful medium. A bachelor’s degree in the field of artificial intelligence would be too good to be true. And, indeed, it is true. If you want to see yourself as an expert digital marketer, then enrolling in the classes is an important step."
https://sunway.edu.np/category/uncategorized,"Sunway has been one of the first colleges in Nepal to provide a bachelor’s degree in the field of artificial intelligence. If contents like “how the TikTok algorithm works” catch your attention, then I bet terms like “data science” and “artificial intelligence” would certainly do too. More on this later.

https://sunway.edu.np/data-science-terms,"Data science is the answer to all these questions. Data science is the field of science that applies algorithms, methods, and processes to extract information from random and non-random data. Simply put, it is the process of finding patterns among the noise and using it to predict and solve various problems across a wide range of applications. I will come back to 6 data science terms that everybody must know in 2023, very shortly."
https://sunway.edu.np/data-science-terms,"It harvests the power of statistics, data analysis, and modeling, along with the use of data structures, algorithms, and machine learning to interpret the findings from massive hordes of data. From Spotify’s recommendation algorithms to predicting human behavior, data science has a wide variety of applications in today’s fast-paced world."
https://sunway.edu.np/data-science-terms,"At Sunway College, we primarily focus on bringing the change that is required in the current digital space. The current generation is the Internet generation. According to a report by Statista, in 2021 alone, humanity created 74 zettabytes of data. That’s 74000000000 terabytes of data, in ONE year. That’s up from 59 zettabytes in 2020, and just below the projected 94 zettabytes of data in 2022."
https://sunway.edu.np/data-science-terms,"To understand data science, here are a few of the basic keywords and terms that you need to know about today."
https://sunway.edu.np/data-science-terms,"In computer science, we can define an algorithm as a specific set of processes used to solve a problem or perform computation. Algorithms are hardware and software-specific instruction lists that complete the given process in hand. For example, the simplest of algorithms perform tasks like sorting a set of numbers in descending order, while the most complex set of algorithms guide and work on a natural language processing system.In the field of data science, professionals widely employ algorithms. Given the focus on big data, data scientists need precise algorithms to reduce processing times and operational costs significantly. Some of the common algorithms used in the field of data science include Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting algorithms, etc."
https://sunway.edu.np/data-science-terms,"We can define data mining as the process of converting raw data into useful information. Data mining involves looking into large sets of data in a database, analyzing patterns and behaviors of the data entities, and using the result to create better algorithms, strategies, and plans for the business.Data science, as the name suggests, heavily operates on data. Therefore, it means it requires a large amount of data to work with. It involves various data mining and warehousing techniques on the data with classification, clustering, and predictive analysis of the given data. Large companies use data mining to create better algorithms, understand customer behavior, and create AI and ML-powered hardware and software."
https://sunway.edu.np/data-science-terms,"Big Data can be defined as data, that is BIG (literally!). It defines large volumes of data that can be structured or unstructured, mined from various sources in a large quantity. Five Vs define big data: Variety, Volume, Velocity, Value, and Veracity. Big Data is sourced from large, complex sources.Big Data poses a unique challenge addressed by data science. It is a massive capital for businesses and companies that can analyze this data to understand customer behavior, insightful analysis of products and services offered, and predict their purchase and usage behavior. Data science uses various algorithms and processes to derive insights from big data."
https://sunway.edu.np/data-science-terms,"In computer science, we can define deep learning as the process of machine learning that uses structures similar to human brains (called neural networks). Deep learning is used to make better algorithms, data sets, and AI hardware and software."
https://sunway.edu.np/data-science-terms,"Deep learning uses powerful computers and large sets of data with output (called supervised learning) and without output (called unsupervised learning) to understand and predict patterns and outcomes.In Data Science, we employ the use of neural networks and methodologies to study big data with massive models on a large level computational scale. Usually, we utilize deep learning to create better algorithms, and insights on specifics such as user experience of a product, facial recognition, behavior pattern processing, etc. Data science combines the power of deep learning, data, and computer science to generate new insights and value for businesses."
https://sunway.edu.np/data-science-terms,"Web scraping is the web data extraction process used to extract data from websites. Automated technology retrieves bulk unstructured data, typically HTML, from numerous websites in the process known as web scraping. A database methodically stores structured data, facilitating its utilization for analysis, training, and research purposes.Data scientists use various existing frameworks such as Scrapy, a Python-based web crawler. Data scientists prefer Beautiful Soup, a tool akin to extracting and storing large website data in databases. Therefore, we use web scraping for price monitoring across e-commerce platforms and email marketing. Similarly, emotion analysis across social media platforms and news monitoring purposes are also done using web scraping. Moreover, this data can also be fed to machine learning algorithms for training and prediction purposes."
https://sunway.edu.np/data-science-terms,"One of the most frequent data science terms. Natural Language Processing is a subfield of deep learning that is concerned with Human Linguistics. It is the process of identifying and understanding meaningful phrases from a human language and generating meaningful phrases and sentences that look like a natural form. NLP includes two sub-sections, Natural Language Understanding (NLU), and Natural Language Generation (NLG)."
https://sunway.edu.np/data-science-terms,"Natural Language Processing involves five phases. Lexical (structure) analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, discourse integration, and pragmatic analysis. Some of the well-known areas of NLP are Speech recognition (Siri, Google Assistant), Chatbots(Maya chat, ), and Optical Character recognition (Google Lens,)."

https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,Have you ever wondered how the TikTok algorithm work? Let us review and understand.
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,TikTok is addictive. It is so addictive that 9 out of 10 users on TikTok use it daily for hours.
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,"How do we spend hours on TikTok, even if it’s a short-content platform?"
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,Let’s understand how the TikTok “For You” algorithm works. We will also cover how the basic recommendation algorithm works.
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,"Before going in depth on how the TikTok algorithm works, let us understand the metadata. Metadata is the data that provides information about the data. This data helps identify and categorize the content for various backend purposes."
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,Hashtags are a few phrases attached to the end of the captions so they can help the algorithm understand the content type. The video uploader usually chooses this. Hashtags are better for a new content creator because they help TikTok identify the type of content they’re uploading.
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,"TikToks are frequently associated with music. TikTok made a significant move by using copyrighted music as a streaming platform, allowing creators to attach sounds without fear of copyright infringement. The music we choose for a TikTok video categorizes it as well, making it one of the more important pieces of metadata."
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,"TikTok is slowly increasing its video content duration limit. The platform started with a 15-second video uploaded over 10 minutes today. The length of the video also categorizes it, making it metadata for a TikTok video."
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,The creator uploading the content is by far the most critical metadata to categorize TikTok videos.
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,"Similarly, other metadata such as uploaded time, location, date, and video quality are a few other examples of metadata for a TikTok video."
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,"When a video is released, TikTok usually sends it to all of its active users at once, who are usually chosen based on the metadata of the video that they are watching."
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,"Implicit ratings are ratings that occur as a result of behavior and cannot be faked by the user. For example, ordering a product from an online store."
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,A few implicit ratings for TikTok videos are:
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,View Time:
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,"During the initial video shoot, TikTok closely monitors the average watch duration of the video. There is a trend of looping a TikTok video so that the end can be unnoticed; the clever creator does it so that the watch duration exceeds the actual content duration, signaling the TikTok algorithm."
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,Video Skips:
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,A video viewer usually skips a video when they don’t like it. This can be an important signal for TikTok to stop recommending the video that has been skipped and instead recommend some other content category.
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,Profile Visit
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,"When consumers like the video, they usually visit the creator’s profile. This can count as an implicit rating as the user is indicating that they like the creator and want to consume similar content."
https://sunway.edu.np/how-does-tiktok-algorithm-work,"Explicit ratings are the ratings that the user explicitly creates, which means there’s some effort in creating explicit ratings. For example, liking a TikTok video"

https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and I’m excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, it’s not that straightforward."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"🍿 Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, it’s essential to note that not all genres are following this trend."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,Here’s what I discovered:
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"📉 Decline in Length: Genres like Children’s and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"📈 Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"If we’re going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first we’ll need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Let’s start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary!"
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. We’ll also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Let’s perform these steps now."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friend’s assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friend’s aggregations, we’re limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including:"
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path ""datasets/netflix_data.csv"". Let’s create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friend’s data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, it’s clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show (perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons)?"
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While we’re at it, we don’t need information from all of the columns, so let’s create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,Let’s put our data subsetting skills to work!
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Okay, now we’re getting somewhere. We’ve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Let’s try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so let’s try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Let’s filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as “Children”, “Stand-Up”, and “Documentaries”. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color!"
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here!"
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"This time, we’ll also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use(). The latter isn’t taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here!"
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as children’s movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we can’t know for certain until we perform additional analyses."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"Congratulations, you’ve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/09,"We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey!"

https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"Generative AI revolutionizes the creative process by allowing humans to supervise while machines generate. This shift relieves us from tedious, risky, and challenging tasks, enabling us to concentrate on the core aspects of our work: vision, ideas, and purpose. It represents a transformative change in the future of employment."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,Importance of Generative AI
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"Generative AI, like photography and celluloid film, represents an incredible creative revolution. It reduces the necessity for creative skill in painting or singing, just as photography emancipated us from relying entirely on artists to depict the truth."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"The influence of Generative AI goes beyond creativity, giving rapid access to clear information and the automatic development of varied material such as news stories, product descriptions, bespoke designs, music, visual effects, and more."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"It is redefining not only specialized professions as well as our view of work, as AI models increasingly aid with repetitive or computational activities in the manufacturing process."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,How is Generative AI different from other AI?
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"In contrast to other forms of artificial intelligence, generative AI focuses on producing new material, whereas discriminative AI classifies existing data."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"Generative AI is used for picture production, video synthesis, language generation, and music composition. It is one of the subcategories of artificial intelligence that encompasses various activities done by AI systems."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"Reactive machines for self-driving cars, limited memory AI for weather forecasting, theory of mind for virtual customer assistance, narrow AI for personalized product suggestions in e-commerce, supervised learning for object identification, unsupervised learning for fraud detection in banking, and reinforcement learning for teaching machines to play games are all examples of these tasks."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"Generative AI encompasses several of these areas and continues to grow, with its primary goal being the production of new material, whether writing, graphics, or product suggestions."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,How Generative AI works?
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"To recognize patterns and produce new results, generative AI employs techniques such as neural networks and deep learning algorithms. It learns the basic principles guiding the content by studying a vast dataset."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"It generates fresh data by sampling from a previously learned distribution. The model refines the output to fit the desired outcome through a process known as “inference,” making it more realistic and aligned with user preferences."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,Generative AI Models
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,1. Natural Language Model
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"Natural Language Model is the most well-known model of Generative AI, with ChatGPT making headlines. The majority of the excitement around text-based Generative AI is centered on a model known as GPT-3. It’s a language model created by OpenAI, a research group dedicated to the development and promotion of friendly AI."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"For example, while computers cannot “understand” language in the same way that humans can, natural language technologies are becoming more effective at identifying the context and meaning of phrases and words and converting them into suitable responses—and actions."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a well-known form of Generative AI. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator that work together to enhance the generator’s ability to generate realistic data.
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"Over time, the generator improves its capacity to synthesize lifelike data, resulting in the creation of new items, assets, faces, and even people."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"GANs can be utilized for various applications, including generating natural features such as lightning, leaves, roots, eyes, and flowers, as well as seamlessly integrating humans with nature."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"Furthermore, in the context of financial fraud detection, GAN models can generate synthetic fraudulent transactions to train fraud detection algorithms."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,3. VAE and Anomaly Detection
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are a major model used for anomaly identification. It entails training the model on a collection of normal data and then utilizing it to detect occurrences that deviate from the norm.
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/07,"VAE has applications in a variety of fields, including financial fraud detection, discovering defects in manufacturing processes, and detecting network breaches. For example, Google has used VAE to identify network attacks."

https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"Threads is a social networking software developed by Meta, which created Instagram and Facebook. Threads allow you to see a feed of everything that’s going on with your friends or persons you’re interested in."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"You may also upload messages, text, images, and videos. You might also respond to or like messages."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,Twitter has increased the number of advertisements that appear after one out of every five postings. An individual has a large number of bot accounts and improper accounts that need to be detected.
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"Twitter charges for verification, risking fake paid Elon Musk accounts. Limited daily tweets can be viewed unless users pay to increase the limit."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"Threads aims to counter negative sentiment toward Twitter meta, explicitly stating no monetization until the app hits a billion users."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"They’ve adjusted it so that everyone must have an Instagram account before they’re able to sign up, which has significantly reduced the degree of Bot activity."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"Because it’s linked to your Instagram account, you won’t have to pay for verification, and it will automatically transfer from your Instagram to your Threads account."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"Threads’ unexpected buzz makes it seem like everyone is already there, a challenge for new platforms."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"When one of your Instagram followers signs up for Threads, they automatically follow you, giving the user a huge boost in enthusiasm. As a result, threads seem like this New Haven is like a fresh start on Twitter."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"Because of his superb timing and some big-brain marketing, Mark Zuckerberg has become the new People’s Choice hero. They’ve also figured out how to develop an enormous fear of missing out among those on the outside."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"Registering quickly for a Threads account earns you a rating, akin to a race assessment."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"Twitter’s unique focus on news fosters real-time discussions, allowing users to engage and learn about global events and perspectives."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"The app Threads faces a data issue, as it currently does not comply with the strict data laws of the European Union."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"The software also introduces the notion of automated status sharing, which allows users to automatically share their activities and locations. Threads intelligently recognize and share information about a user’s current status, such as location, movement, or even the music they are listening to, using powerful AI algorithms."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"While these capabilities may raise privacy concerns for some users, the app assures that users control information sharing, emphasizing transparency and consent."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"Threads intended to debut in a minimal, stable state for V1, resembling Twitter with deliberate Instagram design aspects."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"Moreover, it is appropriately called since users have begun to refer to Threads as strings of messages, and it’s straightforward, with your newsfeed consisting of individuals you follow and those you don’t."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"It nails the basics—visually appealing, runs smoothly, almost bug-free—making it a less overwhelming alternative to Twitter."
https://sunway.edu.np/threads-vs-twitter,"If you are an AI enthusiast and want to learn more about AI then, here at Sunway College, we offer a year’s undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence."

https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,Congratulations! We are a match.
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,But how does it match? IELTS scholarships and Artificial Intelligence. Am I missing something here?
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,Please allow me to put your misunderstanding to rest.
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,"First, you must understand the relationship between our computer science and artificial intelligence course and the English Proficiency Test."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,"The purpose of giving the IELTS scholarships is to assist and motivate individuals who have shown they are proficient in the English language and who wish to pursue further education.

https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,I am guessing you are wondering about the fee structure too.
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,"What’s more, you must have taken and passed the IELTS test within the last two years, so you must present documentation of your results in order to be eligible for the scholarship. The scholarship will be awarded to a small number of students and will be based on both academic excellence and financial need."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,Because this is a UK degree and the criteria are established by Birmingham City University (BCU).
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,"I want to be clear about why you should care about having strong academic English before I continue. I’m assuming you’ve already completed an English proficiency test, so you already have a basic understanding of its significance."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,"Firstly, Academic English is the language used in academic contexts including colleges, research facilities, and business conventions. It is a formal and specialized form of communication that is important for the academic and professional settings."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,"Secondly,"
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,"✅ Academic success depends on effective communication, and Academic English allows you as an academics to explain your ideas and discoveries in a precise and straightforward manner."

https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,"This is clearly your chance to shine again by studying computer science and artificial intelligence at a 501-600 world-ranking university in Kathmandu, with this incredible scholarship."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,You must demonstrate your English proficiency with the BCU recognized English tests: IELTS/ TOEFL/ PTE; 6.0 Score with each band of 5.5.
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,"So, there you go. If you have passed your IELTS/TOEFL/PTE exam then you don’t need to give any proficiency test to enroll in artificial intelligence."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,And the icing on the cake for IELTS-passed students is that now you have the added benefit of grabbing scholarships to study in your home country as well.
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,"In addition, let me give you a little brief on what it is so that you can also savor the benefit of the IELTS score based scholarships."

https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,"Again, this depends on the kind of institutes you are thinking of enrolling in. The price can go as high as Rs. 10,000 and some even provide on Rs.6000 including books and materials that you will need during your learning."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,"Also, it is up to you to choose the best institution for you. Most significantly, the teacher needs to be extremely competent and able to instruct even the weakest pupil."
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,"Being a high school graduate is one of the most difficult things in the world. Now, everyone’s prying eyes are on you. Your career, your goals, your subject, and your passion are all in question. You’re probably wondering, “Home country or foreign country?” We say, “Why not both?”"
https://sunway.edu.np/2023/02,"Not everyone can ever be sure what they want to do in the future. So, if you appear to be interested in computer science and artificial intelligence, we are confident in our IELTS scholarships for you."

https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,Have you ever wondered how the TikTok algorithm work? Let us review and understand.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,TikTok is addictive. It is so addictive that 9 out of 10 users on TikTok use it daily for hours.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"How do we spend hours on TikTok, even if it’s a short-content platform?"
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,Let’s understand how the TikTok “For You” algorithm works. We will also cover how the basic recommendation algorithm works.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"Before going in depth on how the TikTok algorithm works, let us understand the metadata. Metadata is the data that provides information about the data. This data helps identify and categorize the content for various backend purposes."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,Hashtags are a few phrases attached to the end of the captions so they can help the algorithm understand the content type. The video uploader usually chooses this. Hashtags are better for a new content creator because they help TikTok identify the type of content they’re uploading.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"TikToks are frequently associated with music. TikTok made a significant move by using copyrighted music as a streaming platform, allowing creators to attach sounds without fear of copyright infringement. The music we choose for a TikTok video categorizes it as well, making it one of the more important pieces of metadata."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"TikTok is slowly increasing its video content duration limit. The platform started with a 15-second video uploaded over 10 minutes today. The length of the video also categorizes it, making it metadata for a TikTok video."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,The creator uploading the content is by far the most critical metadata to categorize TikTok videos.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"Similarly, other metadata such as uploaded time, location, date, and video quality are a few other examples of metadata for a TikTok video."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"When a video is released, TikTok usually sends it to all of its active users at once, who are usually chosen based on the metadata of the video that they are watching."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"Implicit ratings are ratings that occur as a result of behavior and cannot be faked by the user. For example, ordering a product from an online store."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,A few implicit ratings for TikTok videos are:
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,View Time:
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"During the initial video shoot, TikTok closely monitors the average watch duration of the video. There is a trend of looping a TikTok video so that the end can be unnoticed; the clever creator does it so that the watch duration exceeds the actual content duration, signaling the TikTok algorithm."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,Video Skips:
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,A video viewer usually skips a video when they don’t like it. This can be an important signal for TikTok to stop recommending the video that has been skipped and instead recommend some other content category.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,Profile Visit
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"When consumers like the video, they usually visit the creator’s profile. This can count as an implicit rating as the user is indicating that they like the creator and want to consume similar content."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"Explicit ratings are the ratings that the user explicitly creates, which means there’s some effort in creating explicit ratings. For example, liking a TikTok video"
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,A few explicit ratings for TikTok videos are:
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,Likes:
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"The user usually double-taps when they like the content, this helps to increase the likes count for a video and helps the algorithm."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,Comments:
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,A comment on a video can act as a powerful explicit rating if there is more time and effort required to do so.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,Shares:
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"Shares are also one of the most powerful explicit ratings as it is one of the rarest ratings, and parallelly, it also creates more exposure for the content."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"As we have understood all the following terms, now we can understand how TikTok algorithm work to  recommended videos."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"Step 1: The user uploads the video, and TikTok takes a few minutes to understand the content based on metadata."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,Step 2: TikTok distributes the video to a few active users in order to collect preliminary consumption data.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,Step 3: TikTok typically suggests the video to users who are watching other similarly category videos based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"Step 4: Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"In conclusion, TikTok is a video-editing app that sends videos to a few active users to collect initial consumption results. Based on implicit and explicit ratings for the video, TikTok usually recommends the content to users who are consuming similar videos. Unless and until the consumption results begin to decline, TikTok will continue to recommend videos to users."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"Social media and its uses have spread like wildfire lately. People are out and about promoting themselves, their products and services, and their way of life, whether for business or personal reasons. This is what is seen as the new normal for many. The study of social media and its utilization is important for making the most of this powerful medium. A bachelor’s degree in the field of artificial intelligence would be too good to be true. And, indeed, it is true. If you want to see yourself as an expert digital marketer, then enrolling in the classes is an important step."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/10,"Sunway has been one of the first colleges in Nepal to provide a bachelor’s degree in the field of artificial intelligence. If contents like “how the TikTok algorithm works” catch your attention, then I bet terms like “data science” and “artificial intelligence” would certainly do too. More on this later. So, keep an eye on the blog."

This gadget has been the pride of Sunway college and also a major source of attraction at different events. Let’s know more details on the devices used, the building process, and the working mechanism of this tech from our student Sabin Shrestha."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"Hello, my name is Sabin Shrestha, and I’m now enrolled in the third semester at Sunway College Kathmandu, Nepal."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"There are many automated devices developed and researched today utilizing IoT. IoT has already made life simpler for us in several ways. It greatly influences how we live our daily lives. However, this initiative is just another one that solicits donations. The project is an automated Panipuri water dispenser, as one would assume from the name."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"An automated PaniPuri water dispenser is a gadget that delivers flavored water in specified amounts by automatically sensing the Puri without manual effort. The panipuri’s flavored water is dispensed using this technique. The system uses electronic components such as an Arduino, a breadboard, a jumper, a relay, and an adjustable IR sensor. The system works on the straightforward premise of detecting an item beneath the sensor and signaling the relay to activate the switch."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"Keywords: Arduino, IoT, Relay, Adjustable IR Sensor"
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"Not just for panipuri, this device is usable in many fields. Below are a few benefits of having an automatic water dispenser:"
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,The device follows 5 different steps to dispense flavored water. Let’s break it down and understand.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,The methodology consists of the following steps for making this project real:
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"Research is crucial to any project. Before starting this project, first and foremost we researched past works, designs, and projects. Other, comparable devices, such as automatic sanitizers, have been the subject of research."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"In system design, we design the device considering its architecture, shape, and size. Also, We also list out the components for the system and plan the system operation and hardware requirements for the project. Additionally, we designed a 3D print."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"In the software implementation process, we create Arduino code in the Arduino IDE according to the design and upload the code to Arduino for prototyping and testing."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"In, Prototyping and testing phase, we test the working of the device with a small developed prototype."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"After the prototype, we integrate all devices and components per design and code. The materials such as Arduino, an Adjustable IR Sensor, jumper wires, wires, a USB charger, pipe, wiring strips, 12 v chargers, stalls, etc."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"In this stage, we gather data and analyze it as necessary. From our analysis, we found, that the object should be 5–6 cm away to sense by the system. And, It takes 3 seconds to get the flavor-infused water from the bucket once the thing is discovered."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"In the result phase, we gather the outcome. As a consequence, we validate if the system operates as intended. Although the dispenser has to be cleaned every day while it is in use. But the good thing is, This project is working and put into action effectively."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"The Automated Panipuri water dispenser is a gadget that senses the Puri and automatically fetches the flavor-infused water. This method can be handy in restaurants, cafes, hotels, etc. Moreover, the gadget has several benefits as we discussed, and is frequently used for automated dispensing in Nepal and other nations too."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"Data science is a field where the use of data assists us in making predictions and concluding decisions. Likewise, with the means of raw data analysis and usage of combined procedures of statistical analysis, data analysis, and machine learning algorithms, diverse insights are generated to use as knowledge."

This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"Now, let’s understand automatic controls and our project."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,We have divided the development process into the following steps:
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy.  Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the project’s outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season.  The result shown in Arduino ide’s serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometer’s serial monitor is compared."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,I would like to express my warm thank you to Sunway College Kathmandu as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project.
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of Sunway College Kathmandu. I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,Conclusion?
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,"The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more."
https://sunway.edu.np/2022/08,The possibilities are endless which we will continue to explore in Sunway College’s research lab and beyond that.

https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"I recently conducted a data analysis project on Netflix movies, and I’m excited to share some intriguing insights with you! In a world where binge-watching has become the norm, I set out to investigate whether movies on Netflix are getting shorter over time. The answer? Well, it’s not that straightforward."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"🍿 Movie Duration Trends: While some movies have indeed become more concise, it’s essential to note that not all genres are following this trend."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,Here’s what I discovered:
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"📉 Decline in Length: Genres like Children’s and Documentaries have shown a decline in movie length. It seems that audiences in these categories are favoring shorter, more focused content."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"📈 Consistency: Interestingly, genres like Stand-up comedy have remained relatively consistent in their movie durations. This suggests that these genres are maintaining a stable viewing experience."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Netflix! What started in 1997 as a DVD rental service has since exploded into the largest entertainment/media company by market capitalization, boasting over 200 million subscribers as of January 2021."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Given the large number of movies and series available on the platform, it is a perfect opportunity to flex our data manipulation skills and dive into the entertainment industry. Our friend has also been brushing up on their Python skills and has taken a first crack at a CSV file containing Netflix data. For their first order of business, they have been performing some analyses, and they believe that the average duration of movies has been declining."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"As evidence of this, they have provided us with the following information. For the years from 2011 to 2020, the average movie durations are 103, 101, 99, 100, 100, 95, 95, 96, 93, and 90, respectively."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"If we’re going to be working with this data, we know a good place to start would be to probably start working with pandas. But first we’ll need to create a DataFrame from scratch. Let’s start by creating a Python object covered in Intermediate Python: a dictionary!"
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"To convert our dictionary movie_dict to a pandas DataFrame, we will first need to import the library under its usual alias. We’ll also want to inspect our DataFrame to ensure it was created correctly. Let’s perform these steps now."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Alright, we now have a pandas DataFrame, the most common way to work with tabular data in Python. Now back to the task at hand. We want to follow up on our friend’s assertion that movie lengths have been decreasing over time. A great place to start will be a visualization of the data."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Given that the data is continuous, a line plot would be a good choice, with the dates represented along the x-axis and the average length in minutes along the y-axis. This will allow us to easily spot any trends in movie durations. There are many ways to visualize data in Python, but matploblib.pyplot is one of the most common packages to do so."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Note: In order for us to correctly test your plot, you will need to initalize a matplotlib.pyplot Figure object, which we have already provided in the cell below. You can continue to create your plot as you have learned in Intermediate Python."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Well, it looks like there is something to the idea that movie lengths have decreased over the past ten years! But equipped only with our friend’s aggregations, we’re limited in the further explorations we can perform. There are a few questions about this trend that we are currently unable to answer, including:"
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Upon asking our friend for the original CSV they used to perform their analyses, they gladly oblige and send it. We now have access to the CSV file, available at the path ""datasets/netflix_data.csv"". Let’s create another DataFrame, this time with all of the data. Given the length of our friend’s data, printing the whole DataFrame is probably not a good idea, so we will inspect it by printing only the first five rows."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Okay, we have our data! Now we can dive in and start looking at movie lengths."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Or can we? Looking at the first five rows of our new DataFrame, we notice a column type. Scanning the column, it’s clear there are also TV shows in the dataset! Moreover, the duration column we planned to use seems to represent different values depending on whether the row is a movie or a show (perhaps the number of minutes versus the number of seasons)?"
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Fortunately, a DataFrame allows us to filter data quickly, and we can select rows where type is Movie. While we’re at it, we don’t need information from all of the columns, so let’s create a new DataFrame netflix_movies containing only title, country, genre, release_year, and duration."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,Let’s put our data subsetting skills to work!
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Okay, now we’re getting somewhere. We’ve read in the raw data, selected rows of movies, and have limited our DataFrame to our columns of interest. Let’s try visualizing the data again to inspect the data over a longer range of time."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"This time, we are no longer working with aggregates but instead with individual movies. A line plot is no longer a good choice for our data, so let’s try a scatter plot instead. We will again plot the year of release on the x-axis and the movie duration on the y-axis."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"This is already much more informative than the simple plot we created when our friend first gave us some data. We can also see that, while newer movies are overrepresented on the platform, many short movies have been released in the past two decades."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Upon further inspection, something else is going on. Some of these films are under an hour long! Let’s filter our DataFrame for movies with a duration under 60 minutes and look at the genres. This might give us some insight into what is dragging down the average."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Interesting! It looks as though many of the films that are under 60 minutes fall into genres such as “Children”, “Stand-Up”, and “Documentaries”. This is a logical result, as these types of films are probably often shorter than 90 minute Hollywood blockbuster."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"We could eliminate these rows from our DataFrame and plot the values again. But another interesting way to explore the effect of these genres on our data would be to plot them, but mark them with a different color."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"In Python, there are many ways to do this, but one fun way might be to use a loop to generate a list of colors based on the contents of the genre column. Much as we did in Intermediate Python, we can then pass this list to our plotting function in a later step to color all non-typical genres in a different color!"
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Note: Although we are using the basic colors of red, blue, green, and black, matplotlib has many named colors you can use when creating plots. For more information, you can refer to the documentation here!"
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Lovely looping! We now have a colors list that we can pass to our scatter plot, which should allow us to visually inspect whether these genres might be responsible for the decline in the average duration of movies."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"This time, we’ll also spruce up our plot with some additional axis labels and a new theme with plt.style.use(). The latter isn’t taught in Intermediate Python, but can be a fun way to add some visual flair to a basic matplotlib plot. You can find more information on customizing the style of your plot here!"
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Well, as we suspected, non-typical genres such as children’s movies and documentaries are all clustered around the bottom half of the plot. But we can’t know for certain until we perform additional analyses."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"Congratulations, you’ve performed an exploratory analysis of some entertainment data, and there are lots of fun ways to develop your skills as a Pythonic data scientist. These include learning how to analyze data further with statistics, creating more advanced visualizations, and perhaps most importantly, learning more advanced ways of working with data in pandas. This latter skill is covered in our fantastic course Data Manipulation with pandas."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayseomanager/page/2,"We hope you enjoyed this application of the skills learned in Intermediate Python, and wish you all the best on the rest of your journey!"

https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"At Sunway College, we have a dedicated research lab (Sunway College Research Lab) where we focus on experimenting and researching different IoT-based devices. Our mini research is also one of the most loved workplaces for some of our robotic geeks. We provide drones, 3D printers, and other essentials that our students request for their research.  One of our IoT Enthusiast, Sabin Shrestha (and team) have developed an IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,Let us have an insight into this from Mr. Sabin Shrestha himself.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"Hello, I am Sabin Shrestha, a Student at Sunway College Kathmandu (March 2021 Intake). Let’s have a good insight on IoT Based Automatic Water temperature adjustor."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"Water heating is part of energy utilization and is a process that is as old as human history. As the mode of water heating is changing from the use of the sun to modern-day electricity. Engineers have now designed and developed a lot of heating water systems. Some of them are geysers, Water heating rods, Solar Water heaters, and many more."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,There is much importance of hot water to humankind. This can be a reason why water-heating systems are indispensable and we find them in almost every personal and commercial residences.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"In the present time, people are facing many difficulties while using heating systems. Waiting for water to heat is a waste of time. There are many aware difficulties we face such as high electricity consumption, hazardous systems, overheating, no mobile accessibility, and the inability to adjust the temperature."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"As our project prototype, we have designed and constructed an automatic water-heating unit. The system is an automatic temperature adjuster that controls a powerful heater in a hot water storage vessel. It has two fixed temperature settings; one is for turning ON the water heater and another is for turning OFF."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,Let us rewind the project from its basics.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,The rise of IoT (Internet of Things) is one of the most rapid and fascinating advances in information and communications technology.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"The term “Internet of Things” (IoT) describes a network of actual physical items that have sensors, software, and other technologies built into them in order to communicate and exchange data with other systems and devices through the internet. The system ‘IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor’ is for adjusting water temperature according to the possible surroundings temperature, humidity, and water temperature."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"There are several problems with the manual water heater. There’s usually a problem with the high-water temperature. Because of this, most water heaters consume high power and lead to higher electricity bills. We also face a problem by adjusting ourselves to use the device usually at constant water temperature. Considering these problems, we made an IoT Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"To operate this system, these are the following tools we used:"
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"The application of this system is very vast as it can be implemented in power plants, hospitals, mountain regions, local homes, dormitories, and lodges. This system is time-saving and cost-efficient, and easy to implement. The tool provides an automatic temperature adjustor, less power consumption, safety, and many more."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,An IoT-based automatic water temperature adjustor is better than other systems as it automatically detects and adjusts the water temperature after it senses the environmental temperature. This system is still in its developing phase but was able to show the results accurately.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"Now, let’s understand automatic controls and our project."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"Automatic control is an enormous term. It covers the control of many variables such as pressure, temperature, flow, level, speed, and many more. In this modern society, there are still a lot of systems that we can make efficient and automatic using IoT."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,IoT Based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor is one of the automatic controlling systems around the world. The difference is that is this system is an automatic water temperature adjustor that adjusts to the temperature and humidity of the atmosphere or environment to which it is applied.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"This project falls under the category of Environmental Engineering. This system has the capability of collecting temperature data of both atmosphere and water. For this, the system involves two different sensors for collecting temperature information, one is DHT11 and the other is DS18B20."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,We have divided the development process into the following steps:
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"We researched system usability, understanding of the recently adopted system, project advantages, project scopes, disadvantages, previous system processes, systems requirements, mechanical parts, and problems related to the water temperature adjustor."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"In this phase, we developed the system flowchart and the design of the system. After the design, we made the pins which will denote the certain mechanism in the system allocated."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"In this phase, we set up the mechanical parts according to the design and assigned the pins accordingly. We utilized Mechanical parts such as Arduino, DHT11, DS18B20, Water Heating Coil, I2C OLED, Resistors, Potentiometers, Bluetooth Module, Jumper wires, Relay, and LED. Finally, we connected all devices to the central device, which is Arduino."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"In a technical setup, we downloaded the libraries, and we wrote the code to make the system function automatically. We also uploaded the program for the system in the Arduino so that the system works properly. Now, Through the code, we assigned each individual device the task to be performed. In this phase, we made the soul of the system which makes the system automatic."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"In the code, DHT11 Sensor first senses the temperature of the atmosphere and then analyses the temperature of the atmosphere if it is hot or cold. When the temperature is hot the system turns off the heater. When the atmosphere is cold, the system turns on the heater. After the heater is on, the water temperature will increase progressively."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"The DS18B20 sensor, a water temperature sensor, also works parallel to sense the temperature of the water. While water is heating, the water temperature analyses the temperature of the water. If the water reaches its preset temperature which is 43 Centigrade, the heater will turn off automatically."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,We also set a Bluetooth module to set the range of the water temperature using a mobile application so that the user can manipulate the temperature of the water as needed. The option for the system to turn on or off was also provided in this application. A crucial aspect involved in this step is the maintenance of the code.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"In this phase, we collected and analyzed the data. The data is shown in a serial monitor where it is analyzed and compared with the thermometer to check the accuracy.  Tools we used to show the were thermometer, and I2C."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"Now, we created a prototype by joining all the hardware components and designing the project’s outlook. The prototype we created is system tested to confirm if the system is working or not. To collect the data, we examined the system in the room to check various aspects of the system, some of which include checking if it is working or not, and even if the provided data is right or not."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,IoT-based automatic water temperature adjusts or reads the temperature of any atmosphere to find if the condition of the atmosphere is hot or cold and gives output by adjusting the temperature of the water as required for the user automatically.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"As a result, we tested the system for the room where it was made. The result of the room is measured, which mostly lies between 14 degrees centigrade to 20 degrees centigrade in the winter season.  The result shown in Arduino ide’s serial monitor, LCD display, and the water temperature thermometer’s serial monitor is compared."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,I would like to express my warm thank you to Sunway College Kathmandu as well as the friends and teachers who helped and encouraged me to complete this project.
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"Also, I am equally grateful and thankful to Akash Deo and Saddam Hussain of Sunway College Kathmandu. I would also like to express our gratitude to all of our friends, Brainycube, and the Sunway family for their assistance and support in making this project a reality."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,Conclusion?
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"We successfully designed, developed, and tested the IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system. There were some updates as well in this system such as replacing I2C LCD with I2C OLED, making applications for the system, and others. The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor project was able to maintain the temperature of water at the preset temperature range after reading the temperature atmosphere. It triggers the LED that creates awareness when the heated water has reached its maximum preset temperature. The components used in building the system were readily available."
https://sunway.edu.np/author/sunwayadmin/page/2,"The IoT-based Automatic Water Temperature Adjustor system could be useful in homes, offices, factories, hotels, cafeterias, manufacturing processes, laundries, industries, thermal electric generation plants, etc. In the future, we can apply the whole system automation using Wi-Fi, make the size and weight of the system smaller, applying in other temperature-related systems, and many more."
